# NSF POSE Phase 2 Application Revision Summary

## Major Changes Based on Team Feedback

### 1. **Clear Single Pitch** 
- **Before**: Three implicit ideas without clear focus
- **After**: Single clear message - "PolicyEngine is building an open-source ecosystem for **tax-benefit microsimulation** that democratizes policy analysis"

### 2. **Dramatic Length Reduction**
- **Before**: ~10,000 words (40+ pages)
- **After**: 3,363 words (~13-14 pages)
- **Reduction**: 66% shorter while maintaining all key content

### 3. **Focus on Core Mission**
- Centered entire narrative on tax-benefit microsimulation
- Removed excessive technical details (QRF, L0 optimization specifics)
- Emphasized practical applications over theoretical capabilities

### 4. **Three Concrete Ecosystems**
Restructured ecosystem establishment around three clear markets:
1. **Policy Analysis Ecosystem** - Government and research users
2. **Benefits Access Ecosystem** - MyFriendBen and navigator networks  
3. **Educational Ecosystem** - Universities and training programs

### 5. **Emphasis on Training and Curriculum**
- Expanded curriculum development section significantly
- Added specific training programs for state/local governments
- Highlighted unmet demand from NCSL engagement
- Created clear pathways for non-technical users

### 6. **Concrete Evidence and Examples**
- USC: Marginal tax rate research "would not be possible without PolicyEngine"
- MyFriendBen: $800M in benefits identified for Colorado families
- NY Senator Gounardes: "For the first time, my staff could model our tax credit proposals ourselves"
- NCSL engagement: States using Excel for billion-dollar programs

### 7. **Removed Sections**
- Eliminated separate "Broader Impacts" section (integrated into Project Summary)
- Removed "Conclusion" section (redundant)
- Cut international expansion details beyond UK/Canada

### 8. **Streamlined Technical Content**
- Reduced technical innovation descriptions to essentials
- Focused on validation (96% TAXSIM agreement) over implementation details
- Emphasized user benefits over technical architecture

## Key Messages Now Clear

1. **What**: Open-source tax-benefit microsimulation infrastructure
2. **Why**: Democratize access to policy analysis tools
3. **Who**: State/local governments, universities, benefits navigators
4. **How**: Training, curriculum, and community support
5. **Impact**: $800M benefits identified, 200K+ users, government adoption

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Application restructured and condensed
2. ✅ Clear single pitch established
3. ✅ Focus on tax-benefit microsimulation
4. ✅ Emphasis on training/curriculum
5. ⏳ Team review of revised version
6. ⏳ Fill in remaining placeholders with specific metrics
7. ⏳ Final proofread and formatting

## Team Feedback Addressed

✅ **Anthony's concern**: "Document lacked a clear pitch" → Now has single clear message
✅ **Pavel's concern**: "Current projects felt thrown in" → Organized into three coherent ecosystems
✅ **Focus on infrastructure**: Emphasized how PolicyEngine is infrastructural for policy analysis
✅ **Training emphasis**: Dedicated sections on curriculum and government training
✅ **State/local demand**: Highlighted NCSL engagement and specific examples
✅ **Length**: Reduced from ~40 pages to ~14 pages

The revised application now tells a coherent story about democratizing tax-benefit microsimulation through open-source infrastructure, with clear ecosystems, concrete examples, and measurable impact.
