Most people carry smartphones that can collect useful information such as steps taken, sleep patterns, and phone use. This information can offer insight into a person’s well-being and has already helped researchers detect early signs of mental health problems, track recovery from surgery, and study cognitive decline. The team developed mindLAMP, the leading open-source platform for collecting health data. As more people use this technology, there is a growing need for shared guidance, support, and coordination. This project builds the foundation for a community-driven open-source ecosystem. Through interviews, surveys, and workshops, the team will identify user needs, bring developers and researchers together, and explore how to structure a sustainable and involved community. The results of this planning phase guide the future development of a shared framework, called LAMPOST, that helps more people use smartphone-based data to advance science and improve health. The primary beneficiaries will be researchers, healthcare providers, and in time, any patient whose health condition could be better understood through real-world digital data.<br/> <br/>This Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) project addresses a core challenge in digital phenotyping research. While mindLAMP, an open-source smartphone-based platform, is already widely used in over 50 clinical and research settings, its growing user base remains siloed. Research teams, software developers, and clinicians often work independently, collecting data, developing features, and applying the platform in ways that are not coordinated or shared. As a result, knowledge about best practices, technical approaches, and real-world impact is fragmented, limiting the field’s ability to reproduce findings and advance medical research. The goal of this project is to lay the foundation for a sustainable open-source ecosystem that unites all contributors. The team will define core software assets, identify governance needs, and explore models for long-term maintenance and community participation. Through structured interviews and stakeholder workshops, the team will map the current use of mindLAMP, identify barriers to collaboration, and design processes to improve transparency and interoperability. Given the platform’s use in clinical settings and its handling of health-related data, the project will also engage legal experts to develop models for responsible data sharing and compliance with privacy regulations. The anticipated outcome is a shared ecosystem roadmap and a community framework that supports future scaling, sustainability, and scientific progress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Representatives from these communities will identify actionable pathways that researchers and universities can take to build a robust and sustainable research OSS ecosystem. The workshop envisions two primary outcomes. First, participants will return to their home institutions with concrete and prioritized ideas about how to build sustainable research OSS communities on campus. Second, they will publish findings from the workshop, including findings for researchers, administrators, and other stakeholders, that will focus on how to create and sustain robust OSS infrastructures in diverse university settings. These findings will also describe best practices for how to translate these ""actionable pathways"" into practical guidance and models that other institutions can adopt.

State-of-the-art instrumentation continually improves the ability to collect these data; however, equally important are sophisticated software packages that perform the careful processing of raw data into calibrated spectra ready for scientific analysis. The PypeIt (pronounced ""pipe it"") software package has emerged as a comprehensive data-processing product that leverages modern, industry-driven support infrastructure for open-source code development. This NSF award enables PypeIt to expand into a full-fledged open-source ecosystem (OSE) that will support nearly all medium- and large-class telescopes owned and operated by institutions in the United States. The wide reach of this effort reduces barriers to processing data from both new and existing spectrographs, improving the scientific productivity of both experienced astronomers and those relatively new to processing spectroscopic data. The OSE also introduces PypeIt support for commercially available spectrographs used by amateur astronomers, enabling them to quickly produce calibrated, science-ready spectra from their observations.<br/><br/>Although initially developed by a small team at the University of California Observatories for instruments at the Lick and W. M. Keck Observatories, PypeIt now supports processing data from more than 50 spectrographs at 18 observatories worldwide. Its success can be attributed to two of its guiding principles: (1) focus low-level algorithms on the commonalities of spectroscopic data process such that they can be cleanly separated from the higher-level specifications of each spectrograph; and (2) employ state-of-the-art algorithms that ensure systematic errors are negligible compared to the fundamental noise limit set by Poisson counting statistics. Building from these core principles, this NSF award enables PypeIt to reach its full potential as a community-wide OSE, meeting a critical need outlined by the 2020 Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics. This is achieved by four primary activities: (1) strategically broadening the current PypeIt developer base to include key staff at seven US observatories (Lick, WMKO, Palomar, MMT, LBT, Lowell, and APO) by directly funding them to enable PypeIt to support processing data from their instruments; (2)  building partnerships with additional observatories both, in the U.S. and abroad, by supporting open-source development by the worldwide astronomical community and by hosting bi-annual workshops that introduce new users to PypeIt and provide real-time collaboration between users and developers; (3) implementing a new community-driven governance structure for the project that improves prioritization of the development activities and is more broadly inclusive of all stakeholders (developers, observatory staff, and users); and (4) extending existing, but observatory-specific, tools that facilitate real-time decision making for observers at the telescope (key to improving observing efficiency) and that streamline long-term data archiving (a key priority of the astronomy community) to new observatories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cryptographic verification serves dual purposes: diminishing SBOM tampering risks and setting a new transparency and trust standard in software supply chains. Additionally, the capability to leverage in-toto's attestations helps to fortify software against a variety of existing and anticipated software supply chain attacks. Industry participants within the growing SBOMit ecosystem are developing tools that will help to integrate the product across a diverse range of applications, fostering a community-driven approach that will protect software used in industry, government, academia, and elsewhere. The detailed metadata embedded within SBOMs by in-toto attestations facilitates a greater level of visibility and control of the provenance of components, empowering automated verification processes that can detect and defend against unauthorized modifications. As the SBOMit open-source ecosystem expands by integrating the product across various software domains, this standardizes a means to generate SBOMs and empower stakeholders across sectors with transparent, secure, and easy-to-use tools.

The biomolecular modeling landscape is rapidly changing with the emergence of powerful machine learning methods, and the recent entry of several computationally designed proteins into clinical trials have marked an inflection point in the history of the field. These disruptions have prompted the Rosetta community to reimagine their practices to enable continued leadership and innovation in the next era of biomolecular modeling. Specifically, Rosetta’s existing paid commercial license model limits Rosetta’s accessibility and impact, and de-incentivizes critical contributions from industry scientists. Second, Rosetta's remarkable success has led to dramatic expansion of both the software and community, yet the operational structure of the community has not been updated accordingly, limiting workforce growth, software development, and the diversity of perspectives that ultimately lead to higher-impact scientific advances. This project will create opportunities for coordinated and strategic software development by leveraging, growing, and supporting the Rosetta community to provide best-in-class software. The project will serve the national interest by driving the next generation of the leading biomolecular modeling and design software that enables scientific discovery and innovation across the health, food, and energy sectors. <br/><br/>Our overall goal of this project is to transition the Rosetta Commons to an Open-Source Environment. Specifically, the team will (1) drive collaborative development, governance and adoption of new artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in molecular modeling through open licenses; (2) develop standardized application programming interfaces (APIs), workflows, documentation standards, and tutorials to fuel the growth of the Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE), while maintaining desirable levels of software quality, security and accessibility; (3) provide support and maintenance for key infrastructure, (4) develop a new governance model to empower leaders in the community to ensure long-term sustainability and broad impact of the projects. This work expands the Open Rosetta Ecosystem beyond the traditional Rosetta codebase, and it allows the community to create scientific breakthroughs through complex workflows with or without traditional Rosetta.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plant phenomics is a field of plant biology that aims to reduce this bottleneck by integrating imaging and computational approaches to non-destructively measure and model plant physical and physiological properties. In general, the sustainability of computational resources developed by the community are lacking due to a lack of knowledge about sustainable software development and a lack of community building by working in isolated silos. These challenges lead to reduced impact of community contributions and inefficient allocation of resources and effort. This project addresses this community challenge with the Plant Computer Vision (PlantCV) Open-Source Ecosystem. <br/><br/>Plant Computer Vision (PlantCV) is an open-source image analysis package that is developed with sustainability in mind, with robust processes and infrastructure in place to support continuous development and integration, and distributed development. In this project, the team aims to 1) develop the governance and recruitment structures that will increase the sustainability of PlantCV as a foundational tool in the plant phenotyping community; and 2) recruit and train developers in the principles of sustainable open-source software development to build an open-source ecosystem around PlantCV and other key software in the community. Contributor buy-in will be fostered by developing a governance structure that gives participants in the community a stake in the decision making of the open-source ecosystem and credit for contributions. Ultimately, this ecosystem could enable the development of annotated public datasets and open-source tools for agriculture. This project: 1) trains ecosystem participants in sustainable software development skills, which benefits both PlantCV and other tools in the plant phenotyping ecosystem; 2) trains and recruits users in the ecosystem to increase the adoption of phenomics tools; and 3) develops a community of contributors and leaders in open-source tools in phenomics that will lead future developments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Illustrative diagrams require deep domain-knowledge and extensive design work. PENROSE is a new diagram format that encodes both domain knowledge and visual design in a reusable way. The PENROSE format contains the source information of diagram design: using PENROSE, diagram authors encode domain-specific concepts and how to visually represent them in plain-text languages. The PENROSE core tools compile this format into static images, animated vector graphics, and interactive web applications. Supporting PENROSE’s expansion into a sustainable OSE would best enable broader societal impacts on education and accessibility. The development of a diverse community of users and contributors from across academic disciplines and industry areas will drive a higher number of high-quality diagrams in research papers, in classrooms, and in public-facing scientific communication efforts. In addition, PENROSE provides the best format to enable user creation of diagrams that are accessible to differently abled groups. The readable plain-text format lends itself to customization for alt text and aural feedback as well as rearranging diagram layout for language localization and color acuity. The project will employ a strategy of open communication, usable and varied forms of documentation, and a culture of highlighting contributions to encourage users. <br/><br/>This project will be used to assess the success of transitioning PENROSE transitions to an OSE in the following ways: gathering data on the nature of contributions to open-source development and diagramming in PENROSE; quantifying and characterizing PENROSE’s adoption and prevalence in published research across domains and disciplines; quantifying and characterizing the impact of PENROSE in educational settings, both for educators and learners; as well as gathering data on the effectiveness of implementations of accessibility foci. To realize the full potential of PENROSE, a standalone diagramming tool is not enough. The aim of this project is to establish a PENROSE ecosystem of open-source diagrams and to integrate PENROSE with other platforms. The primary goals for the ecosystem are to build robust infrastructure for authoring, sharing, and reusing diagrammatic contents and develop a community of expert creators that contribute open-source diagrams in the PENROSE format.

With funding from the Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program, the team will develop an open-source ecosystem around Gen3, which will allow them to more easily accept improvements to the code base from the community, learn about and develop new scientific use cases, and create a governance structure that brings community needs into the Gen3 development roadmap.<br/> <br/>As part of this project, the project will enable development and strengthen the community of users around the open-source data platform Gen3, which will make the product easier to set up and maintain, prioritize features needed by the research community, and make Gen3 more accessible to a broader community, including those with fewer technical or monetary resources. To accomplish these goals, the team will 1) create a governance structure with a steering committee and working groups that will advance the needs of the Gen3 community; 2) improve documentation and new user onboarding; and 3) manage external contributions to the Gen3 source code. With these structural improvements, Gen3 can leverage the expertise of its existing and future users to bring new data sharing solutions to a broad range of researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is the foundational stages of building an open-source ecosystem that will address and extend the impact of smart textiles by making complex woven structures accessible and understandable to engineering audiences. At the same time, the project will open channels to make engineering practices understandable to weavers, broadening participation and opportunities for grassroots innovation. Such an ecosystem can make positive impacts upon smart textiles research as well as the textile industry of which woven textiles alone account for 47% of the global textile market. <br/><br/>This approach to ecosystem development is to transition an existing open-source tool, AdaCAD, to a thriving ecosystem of users and contributors. AdaCAD has been designed and developed in close collaboration with weavers and engineers to address specific difficulties of smart textiles design. AdaCAD overcomes difficulties by applying advances in computer-aided design (CAD) within the domain of textiles design. Specifically, it uses parametric design to provide a standardized and interactive form of documentation that can be shared and extended among diverse researchers. AdaCAD currently supports roughly 100 registered users. This project includes fundamental planning activities that will enable the growth of AdaCAD into an ecosystem with distributed contributors and users. The research team will (1) systematically trace and engage in outreach to smart textiles research teams exploring weaving; (2) pilot a program of monthly virtual AdaCAD study groups focused on onboarding users and transitioning users to contributors; and (3) host a 3-day “governance workshop” that convenes open-source experts from communities of craft and creative code to formulate plans and evaluation metrics measuring the health of the ecosystem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Safety qualification is a vital step for approving the use of safety-critical systems such as used in air and railway transportation, cars, medical devices, and space vehicles. Prequalification is the process of preparing hardware, software, and documentation that can be shared and reused by multiple systems that go through safety qualification. The reduction in cost and effort from using prequalified subsystems can have a huge impact on the affordability of safety-critical systems. A successful example of a prequalification process involves the open-source Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems (RTEMS), a real-time operating system used in satellites and space probes. The prequalification reduces the cost to develop and qualify new spacecraft that use the RTEMS software. This project explores the potential to extend the existing prequalification process to space agency requirements and to other systems that require safety qualification. These systems are vital to critical infrastructure and national security. Reducing the time, effort, and costs of their qualification will benefit society.<br/><br/>At present, limited support exists for prequalified open-source products other than the RTEMS software. This lack of support limits the applicability of prequalification to other open-source software products. It is not yet known how difficult it may be to generalize the prequalification approach to other products. This project is organized around three primary tasks. First, surveys and interviews will seek to discover the extent to which prequalification may be valuable more broadly to open-source software projects. Second, the appropriate means to structure, manage, and sustain a prequalification ecosystem are examined through surveys, interviews, and process assessment of the current practice. Third, the project catalyzes the community of contributors and stakeholders to cultivate interest and engagement in the prospect of an open-source ecosystem focused on prequalification. Through these tasks, this project will scope and plan a new open-source ecosystem that can separate the concerns of prequalification from those of the prequalified software products.

Computational agent-based modeling is a widely used tool in the natural and social sciences. Agent-based models capture the properties of a complex system by modeling the behavior of its parts as many interacting computational agents or entities. Due to its accessibility and explanatory power, agent-based modeling has become a central methodology for investigating a wide range of phenomena including biological ecosystems, molecular and chemical interactions, economic systems, and spread of contagious disease. Over the past two decades, the NetLogo team at Northwestern University has developed a large open-source codebase consisting of the NetLogo agent-based modeling (ABM) environment and many associated products. NetLogo has become the leading ABM platform, with hundreds of thousands of users including both researchers and K-16 educators. Researchers in the natural sciences, social sciences, and policy have published thousands of scientific articles using NetLogo. Educators use NetLogo to engage students in learning about complex systems through inquiry-based modeling activities. <br/><br/>This project will transform the existing open-source product family of NetLogo into a sustainable open-source ecosystem (OSE) that supports a modeling community to both create and remix publicly available models and contribute to the modeling tools themselves. Many individuals have volunteered to contribute software extensions, scientific models, curricular units, textbooks, translations and documentation, as well as to the core NetLogo code. To ensure NetLogo’s future and to achieve lasting societal impact will require expanding beyond the current mode of NetLogo development centered around a single academic lab. This project will create and pursue plans for establishing a managing organization to grow the OSE, including plans for organizational structure and governance, community outreach, community contribution tools and processes, and financial sustainability. The OSE managing organization will maintain and create the infrastructure and processes that the varied NetLogo communities need to sustain and grow their involvement in NetLogo modeling, and assures them of its continued existence. Researchers, policymakers, teachers, and students will benefit from vetted models, tools for creating models, and a community to share and discuss models in a sustainable ecosystem. In the longer-term, the project’s impacts will include increasing modeling practice in research, policy and education, supporting a modeling-literate society better prepared to solve humanity’s complex problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In tandem, an increased awareness of the importance of open data for reproducibility and scientific transparency is making inroads in fields that have not traditionally produced large publicly available datasets. Data sharing requirements from publishers and funders, as well as from other stakeholders, have also created pressure to make datasets with research and/or public interest value available through digital repositories. However, to make the best use of existing data, and facilitate the creation of useful future datasets, robust, interoperable and usable standards need to evolve and adapt over time. The open-source development model offers significant potential benefits to the process of standard creation and adaptation. In particular, development and adaptation of standards can take advantage of long-standing socio-technical processes that have been key to managing the development of open-source software, and allow incorporating broad community input into the formulation of these standards. This workshop aims to create interdisciplinary connections across a wide range of research fields, thereby providing fertile ground for exchange of knowledge and the creation of new and broadly useful knowledge about the application of the open-source model to data and metadata standards. Furthermore, the synthesis that will be generated will be useful for policy makers and funders in determining worthwhile avenues for policy and funding investment to best make use of the open-source production and governance principles in support of broad societal goals.<br/><br/>By adhering to open-source standards for formal descriptions (e.g., by implementing schemata for standard specification, and/or by implementing automated standard validation), processes such as automated testing and continuous integration, which have been important in the development of open-source software, can be adopted in defining data and metadata standards as well. Similarly, open-source governance provides a range of stakeholders a voice in the development of standards, potentially enabling use-cases and concerns that would not be taken into account in a top-down model of standards development. On the other hand, open-source models also carry unique risks that need to be taken into account. The goal of this workshop is to discuss examples where an open-source model for standards development has had significant impact on the practice within a field. Importantly, the workshop will also discuss cases where this model has not worked in the past, and cases where this model is not a good fit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The vision of a Tethys Platform OSE is to enable scientists to better communicate the latest science and thereby enable outcomes like more informed response in the face of a natural disaster, better policies for sustaining our environment, better management of Earth’s resources, and increased public literacy and understanding of the complex processes and interactions at play in the natural environment. Already, the seeds for a global OSE have been sown by various organizations around the world that rely on the use of Tethys Platform. Many of the tools developed by these organizations using Tethys Platform are acting as a global leveler, providing access to science and data from premier organizations to other organizations in countries where there is a dearth of such scientific research and data. The communication channel created by these tools often leads to subsequent collaborations between the participating organizations. An example of the impact of these collaborations is the resulting knowledge transfer between the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) in Eastern Africa and The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Nepal, which led to the development of a flood early warning system in Malawi that was formed around tools developed with Tethys Platform and helped to minimize the impact of flooding that occurred due to Cyclone Ana in early 2022. This project seeks to maximize this type of results by cultivating and growing the Tethys Platform community, fostering an inclusive, diverse OSE community, and providing learning and growth opportunities in STEM.<br/><br/>The work that will be carried out in this POSE project is organized into four high level activities: Form a Managing Organization, Build the User Community, Build the Contributor Base, and Improve the Tethys Platform Distribution. The first activity will involve establishing a non-profit managing organization for the Tethys Platform OSE, codenamed Tethys Software Foundation (TSF). The mission of the TSF will be to promote better communication of the geosciences through the use and advancement of Tethys Platform, facilitate contribution to the Tethys Platform codebase, maintain stewardship of the intellectual property and trademarks of Tethys Platform on behalf of the community, and grow the already diverse international community of Tethys app developers and celebrate their work. The second activity will be focused on growing the user community and expanding it to include scientists in more geoscience disciplines. This will be done through a number of discovery and promotion activities including establishing domain working groups to identify development and other needs specific to each discipline, promoting Tethys Platform at conferences, improving educational curriculum, and holding regular Tethys user conferences. The third activity will involve growing the contributor base. This activity will encourage more Tethys app developers to become contributors to the platform in a pay-it-forward fashion and develop contributor training resources with a formal onboarding process for would-be contributors. The fourth activity will focus on improving quality control, security, and privacy aspects of the Tethys Platform distribution. Examples of specific tasks that will be undertaken include expanding test code coverage and ensuring testing is performed on all major platforms; implementing security scanning of the repository, dependencies, and artifacts; addressing data privacy issues; and establishing formal mechanisms for giving credit to the external intellectual content and data contributors.<br/><br/>Website: http://www.tethysplatform.org/<br/>Source Code: https://github.com/tethysplatform/tethys<br/>Documentation: http://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/stable/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Presentations by open work experts and students and working group discussions demonstrate current trends and explore new research topics. Experts also discuss new science on open work (also called “open organizing”). This new science shows how people who work openly can make decisions about how transparent they want to be and decide who will be permitted to make decisions in their groups.

Despite the large number of startups and large companies developing specialized hardware and software for deep learning, all the existing implementations are proprietary, without a viable, freely open-source deep-learning hardware-software stack. The lack of an open and shared ecosystem not only makes it extremely hard to compare different implementations, it also significantly slows innovation and increases design costs as every organization needs to start their implementations from scratch.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this proposal is to establish an open-source ecosystem that enables the development of full-stack deep-learning systems at scale to build next-generation deep-learning platforms. If successful, the outcomes of this project point toward a future in which developers with a great idea in either deep-learning hardware or software can quickly evaluate, design, and demonstrate their idea in an end-to-end fashion on real hardware and software, significantly lowering the design cost and accelerating the pace of innovation. Specifically, the open-source product consists of three key components based on our mature research projects: Exo for code generation (https://github.com/exo-lang/exo), Gemmini for deep-learning accelerator design (https://github.com/ucb-bar/gemmini), and Chipyard for system-on-chip integration (https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard). In particular, the proposed hardware-software ecosystem will fundamentally address challenges in 1) how to evaluate the end-to-end performance of deep-learning accelerators with the software stack; 2) how to generate efficient deep-learning hardware accelerators for specific scenarios; and 3) how to integrate accelerators with general-purpose cores and evaluate them in FPGA and fabrication.

OSEMatS aims to scope preparatory activities to enable the growth of existing open-source materials research tools into a sustainable and robust Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE) that will have broad and lasting scientific and societal impacts. OSEMatS stems from the team’s nonprofit Materials Genome Foundation (MGF) incorporated in 2018 for “promoting computational approaches in science and engineering through organizing workshops and supporting the development of computational tools and databases”. The existing open-source tools on GitHub developed by the team are PyCalphad and ESPEI (Extensible Self-optimizing Phase Equilibria Infrastructure) for the modeling and applications of thermodynamics, which is the most fundamental component of materials science and engineering, through the calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) method which is the backbone of the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) and Materials Genome Initiative (MGI). An advisory council will be established within the MGF and will include key contributors and stakeholders associated with PyCalphad and related projects, as well as external subject matter experts in open-source governance. The near-term goal of OSEMatS is to develop and execute a strategic plan for a sustainable PyCalphad and ESPEI OSE using an organized and intentional approach through joint efforts between MGF and The Pennsylvania State University (PSU). The long-term vision of OSEMatS seeks to promote the computational thermodynamics library PyCalphad as a foundational component of scientific computing within materials science, supporting a robust portfolio of associated software projects and user cases to enable the integrated computational-experimental fundamental research and data-driven discovery and inverse-design of materials with emergent functionalities.<br/><br/>OSEMatS will engage in several planning and outreach activities with the goal of devising a path to sustainability. OSEMatS will (i) empower its user community to become contributors, mentors, and technical leaders through interactive workshops; (ii) ensure a low barrier for onboarding of new projects by providing access to MGF organizational resources commensurate with transparent success criteria and periodic evaluation processes; and (iii) organize outreach activities and events within OSEMatS in a manner consistent with a commitment to inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA). To organize outreach activities coherently, the team incorporated the nonprofit MGF in 2018, aiming to search for a sustainability model to continue the development of OSE in alignment with the POSE program for the creation and maintenance of infrastructure needed for efficient and secure operation of the OSEMatS. PyCalphad and ESPEI have demonstrated their global impacts on computational materials science for universities, national laboratories, and commercial companies. The POSE program will provide necessary support to kickstart a path to sustainability for OSEMatS, based on the open-source PyCalphad and ESPEI, along with many new ones on the way from the PI’s group and in the community through increased coordination of developer contributions and a more focused route to impactful technologies. OSEMatS will enable better fundamental understanding of materials and efficient discovery and design of advanced materials to benefit our society. The team will actively engage students in these activities via various educational and outreach programs at PSU as done in the past such as the Summer Research Opportunity Program for high school students, the Women in Science and Engineering Research program, and student chapters of various professional societies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural hazards, such as floods, landslides, earthquakes, tornadoes, and wildfires, threaten more than 57% of the US national infrastructure. Modeling these complex natural hazards pushes the frontiers of high-performance computing, multi-scale modeling, in-situ visualization, big-data analysis, and machine learning. Scientific software codes are often developed in an ad hoc manner by university researchers and graduate students with very little exposure to software development principles and practices. The robustness and open-source nature of these scientific codes are essential for the safety and security of the nation, its people, and the environment. The project establishes the Tuitus Foundation (Latin for “to protect or care for”), a sustainable, inclusive, open ecosystem of scientific codes for Natural Hazard Engineering (NHE). The project’s novelties are creating a unified interface that supports integration testing, research reproducibility, and workflow provenance in distributed computing environments. The project supports building scalable, automated testing and workflow management for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. The project tackles the social issues around building and sustaining a community by establishing a Governing Board of Directors and supporting community-driven software development in NHE. The project creates an inclusive community by offering guidelines and training for onboarding and supporting new developers through hackathons and Google Summer of Code. By auto-deploying thoroughly tested HPC software to the NSF-funded DesignSafe Cyberinfrastructure, the project impacts the broader community of 6,000 NHE researchers by making robust NHE codes immediately accessible. <br/><br/>Open-source codes in NHE will significantly impact the decision-making process and regional-scale risk assessment.

This project scopes the creation of an Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE) consisting of two existing open-source products: PreTeXt for authoring scholarly documents and textbooks suitable for all areas of STEM, and the Runestone learning engineering and analytics portal for publishing OER textbooks that support both instruction and education research in K-12 and higher education. The long-term societal impacts of this OSE are open-source textbooks that are made freely available to the nation’s STEM classrooms and students through the Open-Source Ecosystem’s support of instructors, authors, and researchers. Furthermore, the OER has the potential to reflect cutting-edge advancements in STEM education research by removing the barriers between researchers, authors, instructors, and students. PreTeXt-authored works can be converted into HTML, print, and braille formats, enabling the resulting Open Educational Resources to be accessible to a wide range of learners at no cost, an equitable approach to ensuring that all students have the same access to education. <br/><br/>The scoping activities include curating methods to create multifaceted, accessible, and interactive STEM education content, and providing mechanisms for students, instructors, content authors, and researchers to seamlessly interact with textbook materials to produce and utilize analytics. The team will hold virtual meetings of stakeholders throughout the first half of the project, culminating in an in-person summit at the end of the project. Evaluation of the project will include qualitative feedback from meeting participants and experts across the larger STEM OER community, including those from alternative OER platforms and aggregators.

Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) is multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary, open-science collaborative to capitalize on the value of health data using large-scale analytics. OHDSI’s mission is to improve health by empowering a community to collaboratively generate the evidence that promotes better health decisions and care. OHDSI collaborates on many aspects of the journey from data to evidence, including open community data standards, open-source software development, open methodological research, and open network clinical research. The core of OHDSI is about using a standard based common data model to create computable and reproducible analysis on electronic health data.  Electronic health data has privacy protections and restrictions on data sharing.  OHDSI has developed methods to convert local proprietary electronic medical record data into a common format thereby allowing the ecosystem to share code (analysis) between organizations and aggregating only result data. The OHDSI community has grown since its inception in 2014 to include >3000 researchers in >70 countries around the world.  The community has created a research network of 810 million patient records across 300+ sites in a common data format.  There are hundreds of OHDSI-affiliated projects on github using the common data model.<br/><br/>  <br/>The goal of this project is to mature the open source governance in the OHDSI ecosystem and create an “OHDSI Way”. OHDSI currently hosts over 200 open source repositories on github with 13 million lines of code written by over 400 contributors.  The specific aims of the project are to formalize open source governance activities, develop contributor onramp programs, host developers conferences, and develop metrics and a dashboard to evaluate the health and maturity of the open source projects.  The project will help the OHDSI community make a broader impact into the field of observational research in two ways.  The first is by enabling stable and secure software that can be used to preform analytics inside health systems and industry with a low deployment and maintenance costs.  The second is by enabling greater extensibility of the ODHSI ecosystem to make the software easier to modify and extend for new purposes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Community infrastructure includes housing structures, electrical power, water and wastewater, transportation, and communication networks - all systems on which the economic and social well-being of any community depend.  These systems are susceptible to damage due to natural hazards, such as hurricanes and floods, tornadoes, wildfires, earthquakes, and tsunamis. In additional to economic losses, damage to a community’s physical infrastructure has been shown to have a significant impact on its social systems.  Community resilience planning encompasses the community’s preparedness, response to and recovery from a damaging event. Enhancing community resilience remains a national imperative as reflected in recent significant financial investments in resilience enhancement at federal, state, and local levels and progress in disaster-related science and technology. IN-CORE is an open-source, comprehensive environment that can model a community across its physical, social, and economic systems.  The project includes the complex interdependencies within and across various infrastructure systems. The need to adapt, mitigate, and improve these systems has become critical as the natural disasters increase.  The proposed open-source ecosystem (OSE) project for IN-CORE will result in a rapid acceleration and adoption of the science of resilience modeling by harnessing the power and breadth of open-source. Researchers will be able to examine undiscovered and indirect interdependencies of the physical, social, and economic systems within a community using scientific algorithms and interdependencies. The datasets provided by the ecosystem can be used for validation and verification of new models and implementations. Finally, the de facto ontology and standards for resilience research will be formed by the ecosystem.  The project’s impacts include the development of science-based, validated tools that are needed to make risk- and resilience-informed policy decisions.  These tools include the ability to quantify the effects of policy decisions at the community level, and on the population and local economy over time.  This ability to perform “what if” scenarios for long-term quantitative planning will be enabled by this OSE project.<br/><br/>In this NSF POSE Phase I project the team will begin by hosting focus group meetings among project participants and key stakeholders to operationalize metrics for success and engage in community building.  The founding open-source ecosystem (OSE) committee will partner with a consulting resource to identify appropriate organizational and governance models with continued engagement throughout the project.  Project activities will culminate with a final refinement of the governance structure and identification of methods for scaling the OSE.  IN-CORE models are open source-driven and improvement/additions in these models will enable broader impacts in both research and graduate education. Specifically, the ability for students to utilize IN-CORE as the computational environment for their theses and dissertations, investigators to write proposals and complete research projects, and enable training of IN-CORE users who can serve as consultants.  The IN-CORE ecosystem requires review and validation of science related to community resilience and thus while the code contribution may be of very good quality and good functionality, the scientific contribution must also be fully validated by the contributor. Secondly, the data contribution to ecosystems is very important, and therefore IP management for data is as equally important as the software IP. However, we recognize that a rigorous review process could hinder contributions to the ecosystem. Therefore, the IN-CORE OSE will consider how to maintain the scientific quality/validation of the contributions while encouraging the contributions.  This Phase I POSE project is an ideal setting to balance these complex and conflicting needs for the IN-CORE OSE.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The past decade has been characterized by a momentous shift in the energy landscape with over $2.6 trillion invested in the exponential growth of renewable energy (RE). More than 80% of all new electrical generation added in 2020 was from RE sources. However, a great bulk of this addition was for utility (>5MW) and distributed scale generation (>500kW) and not at the consumer level integration.  The main mission of this research project is to scope an open-source ecosystem (OSE) which will increase consumer adoption and support academic teaching and research in the RE space.  The project’s novelties are providing consumers, researchers, and educators with intuitive, easy to operate open-source software and hardware to control, connect, and modify RE systems, along with access to large open data sets to analyze variables that affect various solutions.  The project’s impacts are 1) addressing the legal, security, sustainability, reliability, and training areas needed for a successful OSE around the software, hardware, and data platforms, and 2) enabling pathways for development by growing the user base and creating a community of practice that will demonstrate uses of the products and support ease of mass adoption across multiple sectors in the academic and consumer RE space.  Enhancing these platforms and communities makes the individual consumer and institutional level researcher and educator compete with industry giants in the RE space and serves as a force multiplier in the United States’ quest for energy independence and reduction in greenhouse gasses.  Beyond RE, these platforms have applicability to and can be modified by developers in other relevant fields needing similar solutions such as water ecology and water remediation, small batch manufacturing, and a host of agrisciences.<br/><br/>At the consumer and academia levels, significant barriers to RE implementation remain that need<br/>to be addressed. This project’s team of researchers is focused on three items that have been identified by industry, academia, government, and consumers as critical gaps to broader development and usage of renewables: 1) open-source free Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) interfaces to control and monitor renewable energy assets (software), 2) open-source hardware applications for diagnostic, smart relay, and microinverter purposes to affordably connect, operate, and modify renewables (hardware), and 3) access to large data sets to research and understand all variables associated with renewable integration (data sets).

During the past decade, many K-12 schools have established makerspaces with three dimensional (3D) printers, digital die cutters, and other fabrication tools. To facilitate effective use of school makerspaces, an open-source ecosystem is being developed to provide students and educators with curated, carefully reviewed Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models. The ecosystem will be structured around an existing open-source Educational CAD Model Repository. The long-term ecosystem includes a clearinghouse for CAD models with (a) peer-reviewed articles describing classroom use, and (b) the models linked to associated downloadable files in the repository. Accepted practitioner-based articles will be published in a new journal, Educational Fabrication & Design (ED&F), established as one component of the ecosystem. The project’s novelty is that educational CAD models will be externally reviewed, tested, and validated before they are added to the repository. The widespread availability of design and fabrication tools in K-12 makerspaces offers the potential to create new objects and remix existing designs. Science, mathematics, and engineering educators and their students will benefit from access to carefully curated models and associated instructional materials. The resulting open-source ecosystem’s impact will increase effective use of K-12 makerspaces across all of the relevant disciplines and lead to broader literacy in design and fabrication.<br/><br/>During the one year scoping activities of this project, the International Technology and Engineering Education Association (ITEEA) will revise its flagship curriculum, Engineering by Design (EbD © ITEEA), to incorporate the ecosystem constructed around the repository of CAD models. More than 5,000 teachers and more than 50,000 students using the curriculum can engage with the models integrated as a keystone element of the revised curriculum. In addition, the Fab Foundation, established through the Center for Atoms and Bits at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), will collaborate to engage a network of 2,000 Fabrication Laboratories (FabLabs) in this process.

Tapis maximizes application portability, allowing flexible scheduling of geographically distributed computational workloads, offering a HTTP-based RESTful API science-as-a-service to enable multi-facility, decentralized deployments, and provide production-grade support for sensors and streaming data. By transforming Tapis to an Open Source Ecosystem, Tapis leadership will establish organization and governance structures along with contribution pathways and processes for the greater community ecosystem, including reusable Tapis artifacts such as containerized functions, applications and Jupyter notebooks, in addition to the core code base. Tools to accelerate community development, such as push-button sandbox environments, template and scaffold libraries for SDK, CLI and user interfaces, will also be identified and adopted.<br/> <br/>The project’s primary objectives will be to grow and strengthen the engagement of developer communities to provide long-term sustainment. These engagements will look at opportunities to shift the community from not only being users of Tapis but also contributors to Tapis. The project team believes deeply in the power and importance of an open, inclusive, community driven approach to software development, and the POSE program will enable us to create inroads to direct engagement by the developer community. By making Tapis an OSE, going beyond source code, Tapis will evolve to an ecosystem of components that the community can contribute to at any level of expertise. To this end the project will engage beyond existing user base and pursue community members amongst teaching intensive institutes and EPSCOR communities via student mentoring and hackathons to broaden outreach and create opportunities to contribute to the Tapis ecosystem.<br/><br/>Further details about the Tapis project can be found on https://tapis-project.org/ including a getting started guide at https://tapis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
