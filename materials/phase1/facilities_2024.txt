Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources
PolicyEngine will leverage the following resources to carry out the proposed work:
Computational Infrastructure
	•	Cloud computing resources: PolicyEngine utilizes scalable cloud infrastructure to host its modeling platform, web application, and APIs. This includes virtual machines, databases, and storage systems necessary for development, testing, and production deployment.
	•	Version control and collaboration tools: The project uses industry-standard tools such as Git for version control and GitHub for collaborative software development, issue tracking, and documentation.
	•	Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines: Automated testing and deployment infrastructure ensures code quality and facilitates rapid iteration.
Software and Data Resources
	•	Open-source codebase: PolicyEngine's existing codebase, including tax-benefit microsimulation models for the US and UK, provides a strong foundation for further development.
	•	Integrated datasets: Curated microdata sets form the basis for policy simulations and impact analyses.
	•	Third-party open-source libraries: PolicyEngine leverages a variety of open-source statistical, data science, and web development libraries.
Personnel Expertise
	•	Core development team: A multidisciplinary team with expertise in economics, public policy, software engineering, and data science.
	•	Open-source contributor network: A growing community of volunteer developers, economists, and policy experts who contribute to various aspects of the project.
	•	Advisory network: Access to subject matter experts in academia, think tanks, and government agencies who provide guidance on model development and policy analysis.
Organizational Resources
	•	Nonprofit status: PolicyEngine operates under the fiscal sponsorship of the Policy Simulation Library Foundation, providing administrative and legal infrastructure.
	•	Community engagement platforms: Slack workspace and other communication tools to facilitate collaboration among team members and the broader community.
	•	Project management tools: Software for task tracking, roadmap planning, and team coordination.
PolicyEngine is committed to making these resources available for the successful execution of the proposed work. The organization's lean operational model and ability to leverage open-source contributions allow for efficient use of resources in pursuing its mission of democratizing access to policy analysis tools.
