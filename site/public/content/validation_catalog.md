Validation Catalog — Peer Models and Published Scores

This catalog lists models and score sources for cross‑validation. We will cite these in References Cited per NSF requirements rather than in the body text.

United States
- NBER TAXSIM — widely used tax microsimulation; federal and state liabilities; long‑standing documentation.
- PSL Tax‑Calculator — open‑source Python model of U.S. federal income and payroll taxes; policy parameters and calculators maintained by the Policy Simulation Library.
- Atlanta Fed Policy Rules Database (PRD) — machine‑readable rules for safety net programs; useful for scenario definitions.
- Yale Budget Lab — tools for federal and state policy analysis; public calculators and reports.
- BenefitKitchen — benefits eligibility and estimation platform; scenarios and calculators for safety‑net programs.
- ITEP Microsimulation Model — federal and state tax incidence; distributional tables and revenue estimates (published reports).
- Tax Foundation — microsimulation and CGE models; distributional and macro estimates (published reports and methodology briefs).
- CBO — distributional analyses and revenue/baseline estimates (published reports and methods papers).
- JCT — revenue estimates and distributional analyses for federal tax legislation (published documents and descriptions of methods).

United Kingdom
- IPPR — tax‑benefit analyses and policy papers; published estimates for comparison.
- HM Treasury — policy costing and distributional publications; Green/Blue Book guidance.
- Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) — EFO and policy assessments; distributional and revenue context.

Canada
- SPSDM (Statistics Canada) — Social Policy Simulation Database/Model; microsimulation for tax and transfer policy.

Notes
- Where models are closed‑source, we validate against published scenario results or permissible API/UI outputs and document assumptions and caveats.
- All cross‑model mappings, scenarios, and comparisons are versioned and reproducible; disagreements are tracked with minimal reproducers and plans of record.
