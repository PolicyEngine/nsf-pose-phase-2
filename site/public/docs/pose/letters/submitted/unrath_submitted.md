Dear Review Committee:

I strongly support PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. As a former Census Bureau economist and now faculty member at the University of Southern California, I understand both government needs and research applications for transparent policy modeling.

I am currently partnering with PolicyEngine to measure how enrollment in safety net programs such SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, WIC, SSI, and housing assistance, and the structure of these programs plus tax policies, affects recipients' work incentives. The project, funded by HHS and UW-Madison's Institute for Research on Poverty (IRP), leverages access to restricted use data on household income and program enrollment and PolicyEngine's microsimulation tool to compute households' benefit-inclusive effective marginal tax rates. This project would not be possible without a fully open tax-benefit rules engine. PolicyEngine's integration of federal/state taxes with SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, and other programs reveals cliffs invisible when programs are analyzed separately, with state-specific modeling capturing crucial geographic variations. Thanks to its adaptability, I can use it to answer for an innovative project and apply it to the administrative data.

My research on marginal tax rates and benefit cliffs exemplifies why PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE) is essential for evidence-based policy. Current policy debates suffer from fragmented analysis where different agencies model their programs in isolation, missing critical interaction effects. PolicyEngine's integrated, open approach transforms this landscape. Researchers can analyze the full complexity of the safety net, understanding how programs interact. Real-time updates ensure analysis reflects current law. Transparency allows stakeholders to understand and verify findings, building consensus around evidence rather than arguing about black-box results.

I anticipate our project will create other opportunities to partner with PolicyEngine. For example, through my ongoing work with government colleagues, I will explore the possibility of integrating PolicyEngine's tools at Census for additional projects of national importance using administrative and survey data. And my position at USC's Sol Price School provides opportunities to introduce students and colleagues to transparent policy modeling tools, potentially creating a pipeline of analysts familiar with open-source approaches.

Based on my experience in both government and academia, I strongly recommend NSF support for PolicyEngine's Phase II proposal. The platform addresses critical infrastructure gaps limiting our ability to design effective social policy. PolicyEngine's OSE meets varied stakeholder needs through a community-driven model ensuring continuous improvement and broad accessibility. NSF support will catalyze adoption across institutions, creating network effects that benefit the entire policy analysis ecosystem.

Sincerely,
