Dear Review Committee:

I am writing to express my strong support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal to establish an Open-Source Ecosystem for economic policy modeling. As a Lawyer/Developer leading Rules as Code initiatives at the Canadian Digital Service, I have evaluated PolicyEngine extensively for potential adoption within the Canadian government and can attest to its transformative potential for modernizing how governments implement and communicate policy.

## Professional Background and Rules as Code Expertise

My unique background combines legal training with software development expertise, positioning me at the intersection of policy design and computational implementation. At the Canadian Digital Service, and previously at the Canada School of Public Service's Rules as Code Lab, I have served as project manager, developer, and cross-disciplinary translator, helping drafters, lawyers, subject matter experts, and programmers collaborate effectively to encode legislation into executable form.

Through this work, I have evaluated numerous approaches to computational policy implementation. PolicyEngine represents the most mature and comprehensive implementation of Rules as Code principles I have encountered. The platform demonstrates exceptional legislative traceability, with every calculation linking to specific statutes and regulations. Its version control preserves historical policy rules, enabling point-in-time calculations essential for compliance and auditing. The semantic clarity of PolicyEngine's policy encoding makes rules understandable to both technical and policy audiences, while its compositional design allows complex policies to build from simple, reusable components that mirror legislative structure.

## Canadian Government Integration and Current Use

I am actively working to integrate PolicyEngine into Canadian government systems, recognizing its potential to transform how we deliver services to citizens. Our pilot projects are exploring PolicyEngine for modeling federal benefit interactions, particularly the Canada Child Benefit and its complex interactions with provincial programs. The platform's ability to handle federal-provincial policy interactions is especially valuable in Canada's federated system, where benefits from different levels of government must be coordinated.

We are demonstrating how PolicyEngine can power citizen-facing benefit calculators that provide accurate, personalized information about entitlements. During policy development, we show decision-makers real-time impacts of proposed changes, enabling evidence-based design iterations. The open-source nature is crucial for government adoption—it allows full auditing by our security teams, ensures no vendor lock-in that could compromise sovereignty over policy implementation, and enables collaborative improvement across departments without procurement barriers.

## Commitment to the Open-Source Ecosystem

As PolicyEngine establishes its Open-Source Ecosystem, I am committed to contributing both technical expertise and strategic guidance from the government perspective. I will lead efforts to implement Canadian tax and benefit rules within PolicyEngine, creating a foundation for broader government adoption. My position allows me to champion PolicyEngine adoption within Canadian federal and provincial governments, demonstrating its value through successful implementations.

I will contribute best practices from our Rules as Code Lab experience, helping other governments navigate the transition from traditional policy implementation to computational approaches. Given Canada's bilingual requirements, I will help develop French-language capabilities essential for Canadian deployment and valuable for francophone communities worldwide. The knowledge exchange between US, Canadian, and UK implementations will accelerate progress in all jurisdictions, and I am committed to facilitating this cross-border learning.

## Strategic Importance for Government Modernization

Governments worldwide are recognizing that policy implementation through code requires fundamental changes in how we work. The traditional model, where policy is written in legal language then interpreted by programmers months or years later, creates dangerous gaps between intent and implementation. These gaps lead to incorrect benefit calculations, delayed service delivery, and erosion of public trust.

PolicyEngine's OSE offers a better path by enabling policy makers to see exactly how their rules are encoded and verify accuracy before deployment. Service designers can build user interfaces confident that underlying calculations are correct. Auditors can trace every calculation back to its legislative authority. Citizens can understand not just what they're entitled to, but why. Researchers can analyze policy impacts using the same tools government uses, ensuring alignment between academic analysis and operational reality.

## International Collaboration and Standards Development

PolicyEngine's OSE can catalyze international collaboration on challenges common to all democratic governments. By establishing harmonized modeling standards, countries can share solutions while maintaining sovereignty over policy choices. Cross-country learning on validation methods will improve accuracy for all participants. Comparative analysis tools will help policy makers understand how different approaches to similar problems perform in practice.

Canada's extensive experience with Rules as Code, combined with our commitment to open government and bilingual service delivery, positions us as valuable contributors to the OSE. Our participation will strengthen the ecosystem while advancing our domestic digital government objectives.

## Recommendation

Based on my extensive experience modernizing government policy implementation, I strongly recommend NSF support for PolicyEngine's Phase II proposal. The platform provides critical infrastructure for 21st-century governance, enabling governments to implement policy accurately, transparently, and efficiently. The OSE will ensure this infrastructure remains open, improves continuously through community contribution, and serves democratic governments worldwide.

The combination of technical sophistication, commitment to openness, and practical government application makes PolicyEngine uniquely positioned to transform how societies implement and understand public policy. NSF support will accelerate adoption across government agencies internationally, multiplying the impact of this investment in democratic infrastructure.

Sincerely,
