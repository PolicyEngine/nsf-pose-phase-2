Dear Review Committee:

I strongly support PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. As a Lawyer/Developer leading Rules as Code at the Canadian Digital Service, PolicyEngine has inspired our approach to modernizing government policy implementation, particularly through its use of AI coding agents and modern software practices.

## Rules as Code Leadership

My legal and development background positions me at the intersection of policy design and computational implementation. PolicyEngine's AI coding agents for automating rule encoding highlights efficiency gains possible when modernizing from Canada's dated architectures to modern Python stacks. The platform's transparency through open-source, CI/CD, and TDD provides crucial counterweight to black-box models proliferating elsewhere.

## Canadian Exploration

While awaiting PolicyEngine's Canadian model, we see transformative potential for modeling federal-provincial benefit interactions, particularly the Canada Child Benefit. PolicyEngine's practices—open-source, comprehensive testing, version control—establish standards for government adoption without vendor lock-in or procurement barriers.

## OSE Interest

Once the Canadian model is developed, I would be interested in exploring implementation validation and sharing Rules as Code Lab best practices. French-language capabilities would be essential for Canadian deployment and valuable for francophone communities worldwide.

## Strategic Value

PolicyEngine's AI-accelerated rule encoding with rigorous testing shows how to reduce policy-to-implementation time while maintaining accuracy. The modern practices—Python architectures, CI/CD pipelines—represent the future of government technology.

Canada's Rules as Code experience and bilingual requirements position us as valuable OSE contributors, strengthening the ecosystem while advancing our digital government objectives.

## Recommendation

Based on my extensive experience modernizing government policy implementation, I strongly recommend NSF support for PolicyEngine's Phase II proposal. The platform provides critical infrastructure for 21st-century governance, enabling governments to implement policy accurately, transparently, and efficiently. The OSE will ensure this infrastructure remains open, improves continuously through community contribution, and serves democratic governments worldwide.

The combination of technical sophistication, commitment to openness, and practical government application makes PolicyEngine uniquely positioned to transform how societies implement and understand public policy. NSF support will accelerate adoption across government agencies internationally, multiplying the impact of this investment in democratic infrastructure.

Sincerely,
