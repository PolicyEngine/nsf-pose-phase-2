# Letter of Support - George Callas, Arnold Ventures

**[TO BE PRINTED ON ARNOLD VENTURES LETTERHEAD]**

NSF POSE Phase II Review Committee  
National Science Foundation  

Dear Review Committee:

As Executive Vice President for Public Finance at Arnold Ventures, I am pleased to provide this letter of strong support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal to establish an Open-Source Ecosystem for economic policy analysis.

## Arnold Ventures' Investment in PolicyEngine

Arnold Ventures has invested significantly in PolicyEngine through three major grants:

1. **Local Area Modeling**: Enabling state and local analysis crucial for understanding policy impacts beyond federal averages
2. **Enhanced Current Population Survey**: Improving the microdata foundation for accurate distributional analysis  
3. **Model Validation and Accuracy**: Ensuring PolicyEngine meets the highest standards for policy research

These investments reflect our conviction that transparent, accessible policy analysis tools are essential for evidence-based policymaking.

## Active Use in Policy Development

Our team actively uses PolicyEngine in our work with Congress on tax reform. Most recently, during preparations for the 2025 reconciliation process, PolicyEngine proved invaluable for:

- **AMT-SALT Interaction Analysis**: Disentangling the complex interactions between the Alternative Minimum Tax and State and Local Tax deductionsâ€”two of the most watched provisions in tax reform debates
- **Real-time Policy Iteration**: Testing multiple reform scenarios during congressional meetings, enabling data-driven discussion with members and staff
- **Distributional Impact Assessment**: Understanding how proposals affect different income groups and states, critical for building political coalitions

The ability to modify and examine PolicyEngine's code has been crucial. When congressional staff question specific calculations, we can show them exactly how the model works, building trust in the analysis.

## Commitment to the OSE

Arnold Ventures commits to supporting PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem through:

1. **Continued funding**: We will consider additional grants to support OSE infrastructure and expansion
2. **Policy engagement**: Connect PolicyEngine with policymakers who need transparent analysis tools
3. **Use case development**: Share our experience using PolicyEngine for congressional engagement as a model for other organizations
4. **Governance participation**: Contribute to strategic planning ensuring the OSE serves policy practitioner needs
5. **Sustainability planning**: Advise on diversified funding strategies based on our philanthropic expertise

## Strategic Importance for Policy Reform

The 2025 reconciliation process will shape American tax policy for a generation. Major provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire in 2025, creating a critical window for reform. Policymakers need tools that can:

- Rapidly analyze complex proposals
- Show state-by-state impacts
- Model behavioral responses
- Integrate tax and transfer program interactions
- Provide transparent, defensible estimates

PolicyEngine uniquely provides these capabilities in an open, accessible format. Its OSE will ensure these tools remain available and improve continuously through community contribution.

## The Open Source Advantage

Traditional closed economic models create information asymmetries that hinder good policy. When only a few organizations can analyze proposals, policy debates suffer. PolicyEngine's open approach democratizes analysis, enabling:

- Think tanks to verify government estimates
- State officials to understand federal proposal impacts
- Researchers to improve methodologies collaboratively
- Citizens to engage meaningfully in policy debates

## Sustainability and Scale

Arnold Ventures' philosophy emphasizes sustainable, scalable solutions. PolicyEngine's OSE model aligns perfectly with this approach:

- Community contributions ensure continuous improvement
- Open source prevents vendor lock-in
- Distributed development reduces costs
- Transparent governance builds trust

NSF support will catalyze PolicyEngine's transition from grant-dependent project to self-sustaining infrastructure serving the entire policy community.

## Recommendation

I strongly urge NSF to support PolicyEngine's Phase II proposal. As someone who has worked in senior positions at the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, and the National Economic Council, I understand the critical need for transparent, accurate policy analysis tools. PolicyEngine's OSE will provide essential infrastructure for evidence-based policymaking at a pivotal moment for American fiscal policy.

The combination of technical excellence, practical policy application, and commitment to transparency makes PolicyEngine uniquely deserving of NSF support.

Sincerely,

George Callas
