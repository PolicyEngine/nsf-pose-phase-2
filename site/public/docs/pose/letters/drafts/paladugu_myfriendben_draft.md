Dear Review Committee:

I am writing to express strong support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal from the perspective of benefit access and navigation. As Lead Entrepreneur at MyFriendBen, where we've identified upwards of $800 million in available benefits for Colorado families and recently secured $2.4 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for multi-state expansion, I see PolicyEngine's open-source ecosystem as essential infrastructure for our shared mission of making government operate more effectively and transparently. My background spanning software engineering, startup scaling, and nonprofit governance—including my role as Vice Chair of Next50 Foundation focused on aging and impact investing—has shown me how critical transparent, auditable infrastructure is for organizations serving vulnerable populations.

MyFriendBen anonymously screens households for 40+ benefits and tax credits in about 6 minutes, providing families with a custom report showing potential value (averaging $2,500/month) and application time estimates. We co-designed this tool with Colorado families participating in direct cash assistance programs, ensuring it meets real user needs. In 2023 alone, we screened nearly 5,500 Colorado households, identifying $30 million in available benefits.

Our multi-state expansion demonstrates the power of our partnership with PolicyEngine. We've successfully launched in Colorado, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and Illinois, with Texas deployment underway. By integrating PolicyEngine's open-source API, we deliver benefit screening to residents across these states with over 90% accuracy. PolicyEngine's computational models handle the complex calculations for federal and state tax credits and major benefit programs like SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, and TANF, while we focus on creating an accessible, multilingual user experience. Beyond our current implementations, we've collaborated with PolicyEngine on proposals to help individuals navigate Medicaid long-term care—one of the most complex safety net programs.

Both MyFriendBen and PolicyEngine are committed to open source—we maintain our benefits-calculator, benefits-api, and other tools on GitHub under Mozilla Public License. This shared philosophy goes beyond code: we believe transparent, auditable infrastructure is essential for government to operate effectively. The Gates Foundation's investment recognizes this approach's potential. With PolicyEngine's OSE providing the computational backbone, organizations like MyFriendBen can focus on user experience, outreach, and community partnerships. This division of labor, united by open-source principles, accelerates progress for the entire field.

Our partnerships with Larimer County, United Way of Pueblo County, and county human services departments across multiple states demonstrate the demand for scalable benefit screening. PolicyEngine's OSE enables us to:
- Scale from 2 states to 5 states in under a year, with all 50 states planned
- Ensure consistency in eligibility determinations across diverse state programs
- Reduce costs so more organizations can offer screening
- Build trust through transparent, auditable calculations

The benefits access gap costs families billions annually. MyFriendBen has proven that user-friendly tools can connect families to support, but we need robust infrastructure to scale. PolicyEngine's OSE provides exactly that foundation.

I strongly encourage NSF's support for this proposal. The combination of PolicyEngine's technical infrastructure and organizations like MyFriendBen's user expertise could transform how America's safety net serves families in need.

Sincerely,
