Dear Review Committee:

I am writing to express my strongest support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal to establish an Open-Source Ecosystem for transparent economic policy analysis. As a Visiting Fellow at the Brookings Institution, Adjunct Research Professor at the University of Michigan, and former Assistant Director at the Federal Reserve Board where I oversaw the Survey of Consumer Finances, I have unique insight into both the critical need for and transformative potential of PolicyEngine's open-source approach.

## Professional Background and Perspective

During my tenure at the Federal Reserve Board, I had primary responsibility for the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), the nation's premier source of household wealth data. Before that, as Chief of Long-Term Modeling at the Congressional Budget Office, I directed development of CBOLT, CBO's microsimulation model for long-term budget projections. These experiences have given me deep appreciation for both the power and limitations of economic modeling tools, particularly the constraints imposed by closed-source architectures.

Throughout my career, I have witnessed firsthand how closed models create barriers to research progress. When using TAXSIM for federal tax calculations, researchers must engage in time-consuming back-and-forth communications with the model's developer to understand unexpected results or request new features. Edge cases remain opaque, assumptions cannot be verified, and collaborative improvement is impossible. This closed approach fundamentally limits the pace and quality of economic research.

## Current Collaboration with PolicyEngine

I am actively using PolicyEngine for multiple research initiatives that demonstrate its transformative potential. Most significantly, I am exploring how PolicyEngine's microdata calibration techniques can enhance the utility of the Survey of Consumer Finances for economic research. The SCF excludes state identifiers to protect respondent confidentiality, preventing researchers from calculating state tax liabilities or analyzing geographic policy variations. Working with PolicyEngine, I am developing methods to impute state identifiers using their advanced calibration algorithms, enabling accurate state tax calculations while maintaining privacy protections. This work exemplifies how PolicyEngine's open infrastructure enables methodological innovations impossible with closed systems.

Additionally, I am using PolicyEngine to analyze Social Security reform proposals—arguably the most critical public finance challenge facing our nation. The ability to examine exactly how PolicyEngine models benefit calculations, earnings histories, and demographic transitions has already improved my research quality. I am coordinating with economists at Brookings, government agencies, and other research institutions to transition from TAXSIM to PolicyEngine, documenting the advantages of transparent, reproducible analysis.

## Commitment to the Open-Source Ecosystem

As PolicyEngine establishes its Open-Source Ecosystem, I commit to contributing both technical expertise and community leadership. I will share code for integrating SCF and other survey data with PolicyEngine, extending its capabilities for wealth and distributional analysis. My experience building CBOLT provides valuable insights for developing dynamic scoring capabilities essential for long-term fiscal analysis. I will leverage my connections at CBO, Treasury, Census, and the Federal Reserve to advocate for PolicyEngine adoption in government agencies, where transparent tools are essential for maintaining public trust.

The contrast between closed and open models could not be starker. Having spent years building models within government agencies, I understand that public policy tools must be transparent to maintain democratic legitimacy. When Congress questions CBO's projections or citizens challenge tax calculations, the ability to examine methodology is essential. PolicyEngine's open-source approach enables this transparency while fostering collaborative improvement that benefits the entire research community.

## Strategic Importance for Economic Research

PolicyEngine's OSE addresses fundamental challenges in economic policy analysis. The reproducibility crisis in economics stems partly from reliance on proprietary models whose calculations cannot be verified. Rapid policy response during crises is hampered when model updates depend on single maintainers. Collaboration across institutions is limited when researchers cannot share and improve common tools. PolicyEngine solves each of these problems through its open architecture.

My work on Social Security reform illustrates the stakes. Reform proposals will affect every American worker and retiree, yet most analysis relies on closed models that legislators and citizens cannot examine. PolicyEngine's transparent platform can democratize this critical analysis, enabling stakeholders to understand and verify the true impacts of reform proposals. This transparency is not merely technical—it is essential for democratic governance.

## Recommendation

Based on my extensive experience with both closed and open modeling systems, I can state unequivocally that PolicyEngine represents the future of economic policy analysis. The transformation from black-box calculations to transparent, collaborative tools will accelerate research progress, improve policy design, and strengthen public trust in economic analysis.

I strongly urge NSF to support this Phase II proposal. PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem will provide essential infrastructure for evidence-based policymaking, enabling researchers, policymakers, and citizens to work together in addressing our nation's economic challenges. The time for open, transparent policy analysis has arrived, and PolicyEngine is uniquely positioned to lead this transformation.

Please feel free to contact me if you require any additional information about PolicyEngine's capabilities or my collaboration with their team.
