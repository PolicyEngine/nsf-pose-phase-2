NSF POSE Phase II Review Committee  
National Science Foundation  

Dear Review Committee:

I write to offer my strongest support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. Having worked extensively with both closed-source models like TAXSIM and PolicyEngine's open-source platform, I can attest to the transformative impact that PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem will have on economic policy research and analysis.

## My Experience: From Closed to Open Source

As the former chief of the Macroeconomic Analysis unit at the Congressional Budget Office, I directed the development of CBOLT, CBO's long-term budget model. That experience, combined with my recent work coordinating TAXSIM users across government agencies and think tanks, has given me unique insight into both the power and limitations of closed-source economic models.

Working with TAXSIM often required iterative communication with its developer to understand unexpected results or implement new features. With PolicyEngine, I can directly examine the code, understand the logic, and even contribute improvements. This transformation from black-box to transparent analysis is revolutionary for policy research.

## Current Use and Collaboration

I am currently using PolicyEngine for multiple research projects:

1. **Survey of Consumer Finances Integration**: Working with PolicyEngine to analyze wealth and income dynamics using SCF microdata, leveraging their platform's ability to process custom datasets
2. **Social Security Reform Analysis**: Exploring how PolicyEngine's infrastructure can support dynamic microsimulation for Social Security reformâ€”arguably the most critical public finance challenge of the coming decade
3. **TAXSIM Transition Coordination**: Helping government economists and Brookings researchers transition from TAXSIM to PolicyEngine, documenting advantages and ensuring continuity

The ability to see exactly how PolicyEngine handles edge cases, behavioral responses, and policy interactions has already improved the quality and credibility of my research.

## Commitment to the OSE

As PolicyEngine establishes its Open-Source Ecosystem, I commit to:

- **Technical contribution**: Share code for integrating SCF and other survey data, extending PolicyEngine's capabilities for wealth analysis
- **Government adoption**: Leverage my CBO and Treasury connections to advocate for PolicyEngine adoption in government agencies
- **Research community building**: Coordinate with economists at Brookings, Urban Institute, and universities to establish best practices for using PolicyEngine in academic research
- **Dynamic modeling expertise**: Contribute insights from CBOLT development to help PolicyEngine build dynamic scoring capabilities essential for long-term fiscal analysis
- **Documentation and training**: Develop materials helping researchers transition from closed-source tools to PolicyEngine's open platform

## The Open Source Imperative

My experience building models at CBO taught me that public policy tools must be transparent to maintain public trust. When Congress questions CBO's projections, transparency in methodology is essential. PolicyEngine's open-source approach enables this transparency while fostering collaborative improvement impossible with proprietary models.

The Social Security reform debate exemplifies why we need PolicyEngine's OSE. Reforms will affect every American, yet most analysis relies on closed models. PolicyEngine's transparent, collaborative platform can democratize this analysis, enabling researchers, policymakers, and citizens to understand proposals' true impacts.

## Strategic Value

PolicyEngine's OSE addresses critical needs:

- **Reproducibility crisis**: Open code ensures research can be validated and replicated
- **Collaborative improvement**: Researchers contribute enhancements benefiting everyone
- **Rapid policy response**: Open infrastructure enables quick analysis of emerging proposals
- **Trust through transparency**: Policymakers and citizens can verify analytical methods

NSF support will catalyze a transformation in economic policy analysis. I strongly urge you to fund this essential infrastructure for evidence-based policymaking.

Sincerely,
