NSF POSE Phase II Review Committee  
National Science Foundation  

Dear Review Committee:

I am writing to express the National Bureau of Economic Research's strong support for PolicyEngine's Phase II proposal to establish an Open-Source Ecosystem for transparent, accessible economic policy analysis.

Since our initial letter of support and subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with PolicyEngine, our collaboration has deepened significantly. PolicyEngine has developed an automated comparison tool that validates their calculations against TAXSIM across hundreds of thousands of tax scenarios, demonstrating both technical rigor and commitment to accuracy that the research community demands.

## Current Collaboration and Use

NBER researchers and affiliates increasingly rely on PolicyEngine for policy analysis that extends beyond TAXSIM's capabilities. Key advantages we've observed include:

- **Full transparency**: Unlike TAXSIM's closed architecture, PolicyEngine's open-source approach allows researchers to examine and validate every calculation
- **Broader scope**: Integration of transfer programs with tax calculations enables comprehensive distributional analysis
- **Reproducibility**: Version control and parameter tracking ensure research can be fully replicated
- **Rapid iteration**: Researchers can test policy variations without waiting for external model updates

Our collaboration has produced tangible infrastructure improvements, including the automated validation framework that continuously compares PolicyEngine and TAXSIM outputs, ensuring consistency while demonstrating the advantages of open-source transparency.

## Commitment to the OSE

As PolicyEngine transitions to a sustainable Open-Source Ecosystem, NBER commits to:

1. **Contributing intellectual assets**: We will continue providing access to Dan Feenberg's historical tax form archive and TAXSIM validation datasets
2. **Research collaboration**: NBER affiliates will contribute to model validation, particularly for dynamic scoring and behavioral response modules critical for academic research
3. **Community building**: We will encourage NBER researchers to adopt PolicyEngine for projects requiring transparent, reproducible analysis
4. **Governance participation**: I am willing to serve on an advisory board to ensure the OSE maintains the rigor required for academic research

## Strategic Importance

The establishment of PolicyEngine's OSE addresses a critical gap in economic research infrastructure. As policy debates increasingly require rapid, transparent analysis, the field needs open tools that combine TAXSIM's reliability with modern software practices. PolicyEngine uniquely provides this, and its OSE will ensure sustainable development aligned with research community needs.

The proposed governance structure, with representation from research institutions, government users, and policy organizations, will ensure the platform evolves to meet diverse analytical needs while maintaining academic standards.

I strongly urge NSF to support this Phase II proposal. The PolicyEngine OSE represents essential infrastructure for evidence-based policymaking, and NBER is committed to its success.

Sincerely,

James M. Poterba
