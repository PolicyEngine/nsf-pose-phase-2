Dear Review Committee:

I am writing to express the National Bureau of Economic Research's strong support for PolicyEngine's Phase II proposal to establish an Open-Source Ecosystem for transparent, accessible economic policy analysis. As President and CEO of NBER, I have observed PolicyEngine's development with great interest, and our collaboration has deepened significantly since my initial letter of support for their Phase I proposal.

## NBER's Collaboration with PolicyEngine

Following our Phase I support, NBER entered into a formal Memorandum of Understanding with PolicyEngine that has already produced substantial benefits for the economic research community. Most notably, PolicyEngine has developed an automated comparison tool that validates their calculations against our TAXSIM model across hundreds of thousands of tax scenarios. This tool demonstrates both the technical rigor PolicyEngine brings to policy modeling and their commitment to accuracy that meets the exacting standards of academic research.

The development of this validation framework represents more than a technical achievement—it illuminates the fundamental advantages of open-source policy modeling. While TAXSIM has served the research community well for decades through Dan Feenberg's dedicated stewardship, its closed architecture inherently limits how researchers can interact with and understand the model. PolicyEngine's open-source approach allows researchers to examine every calculation, trace the legislative basis for each rule, and contribute improvements that benefit the entire community. NBER researchers increasingly rely on PolicyEngine when their analyses require transparency, reproducibility, or capabilities beyond tax calculations alone.

## Current Use and Benefits

NBER affiliates are actively using PolicyEngine for research that extends beyond TAXSIM's traditional scope. The platform's integration of transfer programs with tax calculations enables comprehensive distributional analyses previously requiring multiple models and complex data merging. The ability to model state-specific policies with full transparency has opened new research avenues for our affiliates studying federalism and state policy innovation. Perhaps most importantly, PolicyEngine's version control and parameter tracking ensure that research can be fully replicated—a critical requirement for scientific credibility that closed models cannot guarantee.

Our collaboration has also revealed how open-source development accelerates innovation. When NBER researchers identify edge cases or propose methodological improvements, they can directly examine the relevant code, test modifications, and contribute enhancements. This collaborative approach contrasts sharply with the traditional model where researchers must work through intermediaries to understand or modify calculations.

## Commitment to the Open-Source Ecosystem

As PolicyEngine transitions to a sustainable Open-Source Ecosystem, NBER is committed to supporting this critical infrastructure for economic research. We will continue providing access to Dan Feenberg's historical tax form archive and TAXSIM validation datasets, ensuring PolicyEngine maintains compatibility with decades of tax policy research. Our research affiliates will contribute to model validation, particularly for the dynamic scoring and behavioral response modules that are essential for credible policy analysis.

I am personally willing to serve on an advisory board for the PolicyEngine OSE, helping ensure that governance structures balance the needs of academic researchers, government users, and policy practitioners. NBER will actively encourage our research network to adopt PolicyEngine for projects requiring transparent, reproducible analysis, and we will share our experience to help other research institutions make this transition.

## Strategic Importance for Economic Research

The establishment of PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem addresses a critical gap in our research infrastructure. As policy debates increasingly demand rapid, transparent analysis, the field needs tools that combine the reliability of established models like TAXSIM with modern software engineering practices and comprehensive scope. PolicyEngine uniquely provides this combination, and its OSE will ensure sustainable development aligned with the evolving needs of the research community.

The proposed governance structure, with representation from research institutions, government agencies, and policy organizations, will create a true community resource rather than a tool controlled by any single institution. This collaborative approach is essential for maintaining the tool's credibility across the ideological spectrum and ensuring its continued relevance as policy challenges evolve.

## Recommendation

I strongly urge NSF to support this Phase II proposal. PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem represents essential infrastructure for evidence-based policymaking, addressing longstanding limitations in how economic policy analysis is conducted and shared. NBER's experience with PolicyEngine confirms that open-source policy modeling can meet the highest standards of academic rigor while dramatically expanding access to analytical capabilities.

The time has come for economic policy analysis to embrace the transparency and collaboration that open-source methods enable. With NSF support, PolicyEngine's OSE will catalyze this transformation, benefiting researchers, policymakers, and ultimately the citizens whose lives are shaped by public policy decisions.

Sincerely,
