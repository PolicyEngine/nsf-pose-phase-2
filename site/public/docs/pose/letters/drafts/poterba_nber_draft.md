Dear Review Committee:

I am writing to express NBER's strong support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. Our collaboration has deepened significantly since Phase I, and I believe PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem will provide essential infrastructure for economic research.

## NBER Collaboration

Through our MOU, Dan Feenberg is working with PolicyEngine to develop comprehensive validation frameworks comparing calculations across hundreds of thousands of tax scenarios. PolicyEngine has built an automated comparison tool that validates their calculations against TAXSIM, demonstrating both technical rigor and commitment to accuracy. Phase II support would enable expansion of this validation infrastructure to compare against additional models, further building public trust in open-source solutions. Dan is also serving as PolicyEngine's external mentor for the NSF I-Corps program, sharing decades of experience maintaining TAXSIM to guide their ecosystem development. While TAXSIM has served researchers well for decades, PolicyEngine's open-source approach allows researchers to examine every calculation, trace legislative bases, and contribute improvements—capabilities increasingly essential as policy analysis demands greater reproducibility.

## Research Potential

NBER affiliates are beginning to explore PolicyEngine, particularly for research beyond traditional tax calculations. The platform's integration of transfer programs with taxes enables comprehensive distributional analyses currently requiring multiple models. State-specific policy modeling with full transparency opens new avenues for studying federalism. Most importantly, PolicyEngine's version control ensures full replication—critical for scientific credibility.

## OSE Support

NBER can continue providing access to Dan Feenberg's historical tax form archive and TAXSIM validation datasets for research purposes. Our affiliates may contribute to model validation, particularly for dynamic scoring and behavioral response modules.

## Recommendation

PolicyEngine addresses a critical gap in research infrastructure by combining TAXSIM's reliability with modern software practices and comprehensive scope. The proposed governance structure will create a true community resource maintaining credibility across the ideological spectrum.

I strongly urge NSF to support this Phase II proposal. PolicyEngine's OSE represents essential infrastructure for evidence-based policymaking, and NBER's experience confirms that open-source policy modeling can meet the highest standards of academic rigor while expanding access to analytical capabilities.

Sincerely,
