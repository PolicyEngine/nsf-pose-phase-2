# Project Description

## Context of OSE

### Vision and Need

Our vision is to establish PolicyEngine as the foundational open-source ecosystem for tax-benefit microsimulation—critical infrastructure for evidence-based policymaking. The need is urgent: current policy debates affecting millions of Americans rely on black-box models accessible only to institutions that can afford millions in annual operating costs. The Tax Policy Center operates at $3.2M annually; Penn Wharton Budget Model at $1.8M. Meanwhile, state legislatures making critical safety net decisions, universities teaching policy analysis, and community organizations helping families access benefits all lack basic microsimulation tools.

Recent policy debates exposed this democratic deficit. When Congress considered the American Rescue Plan's $1.9 trillion expansion, only 12 institutions could independently verify distributional claims. State legislators implementing Medicaid expansion or TANF modifications operate blind to interaction effects. As NY State Senator Gounardes noted after using PolicyEngine: "For the first time, my staff could model our tax credit proposals ourselves instead of waiting weeks for external analysis."

### Product Maturity and Adoption

PolicyEngine has achieved product-market fit with explosive growth and measurable impact. Government adoption spans federal and state levels: the Joint Economic Committee now uses PolicyEngine for analyzing federal proposals. The UK Cabinet Office's integration is so successful that Nikhil Woodruff is currently on secondment there, helping expand usage across HM Treasury and DWP. State legislators in multiple states including New York use the platform, with Senator Gounardes publicly crediting PolicyEngine for enabling his child tax credit design.

Academic validation confirms our technical rigor through extensive testing against NBER's TAXSIM, leading to ongoing collaboration discussions. USC's Center for Economic and Social Research uses PolicyEngine for HHS-funded marginal tax rate research. We've conducted seminars at CBO, Congressional Research Service, and the Joint Economic Committee, with active discussions at Berkeley, Georgetown, Northwestern, USC, Duke, and Harvard about curriculum integration.

The benefits access ecosystem demonstrates immediate social impact. MyFriendBen's $2.4M Gates Foundation-backed platform identified $800M in unclaimed benefits for 50,000 Colorado families using our API. Multiple organizations in the benefits navigation space are exploring migration to PolicyEngine, validating our open approach—organizations choose transparency and community contribution over proprietary lock-in.

Current platform scale demonstrates both usage and development momentum. We serve over 100,000 people per year through our API and partners, with rapid growth as partner numbers and scale increase. The PolicyEngine GitHub organization hosts 146 repositories with over 50,000 commits, 332+ stars, and 620+ forks across the ecosystem. Our comprehensive coverage includes 9,034 parameters and variables—7,828 in policyengine-us alone (4,712 parameters and 3,116 variables) and 1,206 in policyengine-uk—representing the full complexity of modern tax-benefit systems. Each parameter and calculation is traceable to its authoritative source through over 1,800 structured citations to primary government documents embedded in our codebase, ensuring every rule can be verified against official legislation and regulations. Development velocity has exploded in 2025 with 60 new repositories created, compared to just 16 in 2023, representing a 3x acceleration in development pace. With 30+ unique contributors on major repositories and 1,227 open issues on policyengine-us alone, we demonstrate the distributed development essential for a thriving open-source ecosystem. Complete coverage spans all 50 state tax systems plus SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, WIC, and housing assistance, with international expansion underway in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia.

The technical foundation is production-ready: comprehensive test coverage with 8,600 test cases, automated validation against established models, fast API response times, and signed releases with security scanning.

### Phase I Foundation and I-Corps Focus

Our Phase I award (running through July 2026) enables systematic ecosystem discovery through the January 2026 I-Corps cohort. We request Phase II to begin May 1, 2026, allowing us to immediately apply I-Corps insights while maintaining Phase I momentum. Our team—Max Ghenis (PI), Nikhil Woodruff (Technical Lead), and Dan Feenberg (NBER mentor with 30+ years maintaining TAXSIM)—will conduct 100+ stakeholder interviews focusing on three critical questions. First, we will investigate state and local government needs to understand what prevents them from conducting their own analysis, with initial NCSL conversations revealing that Excel-based "models" remain standard despite handling billions in programs. Second, we will explore educational barriers to understand how to integrate microsimulation into curricula, as faculty report using outdated Tax-Calculator or building toy models because production systems are inaccessible. Third, we will examine sustainability models to determine what funding and governance structures ensure long-term viability, exploring consortium models, training revenue, and API licensing while maintaining open access.

These insights will directly shape Phase II implementation, particularly our training programs and state government partnerships.
