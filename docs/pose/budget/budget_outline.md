NSF POSE Phase II — Budget Outline (Draft)

Target: $1,500,000 total over 24 months (≤ Phase II cap)

Assumptions
- No cost sharing; use your NICRA or 10% de minimis MTDC for indirects.
- Senior personnel salary generally ≤ 2 months across all NSF awards per PAPPG; justify any exceptions.
- Single proposal with subawards allowed (no separately submitted collaborative). Execute IP allocation agreement for each subaward (upload to Supplementary Documents).
- Scope alignment: POSE does not fund net‑new core feature development; funds support OSE enablement (governance, security, documentation, contributor onboarding, release engineering, evaluation, training, and adoption).

High‑Level Allocation (illustrative)
- Personnel (salary + fringe): ~$900,000 (60%)
  - PI (≤2 months/year), co‑PI (≤2 months/year), 2 FTE engineers focused on OSE enablement (security hardening, release engineering, CI, docs, contributor onboarding), 0.5 FTE community/partnerships, 0.5 FTE data scientist/analyst for validation and dashboards. No POSE funds budgeted for net‑new core feature development.
- Subawards/Consultants: ~$150,000 (10%)
  - Security audit; independent evaluation; UX research. For consultants >$50k across award: include signed letter (availability, time, role, rate) in Other Supplementary Documents.
- Cloud/Infrastructure/Services: ~$120,000 (8%)
  - Compute, storage, logging/monitoring, code signing, SBOM/scanning, CI supporting distributed development and release processes.
- Participant Support: ~$40,000 (3%)
  - Community workshops/hackathons, contributor training (no employees paid from this line).
- Travel: ~$30,000 (2%)
  - I‑Corps for POSE cohort sessions; partner/government workshops; conferences.
- Equipment: ~$60,000 (4%)
  - Only if needed and meets NSF equipment definition (≥$5k, >1‑yr life). For items >$50k, include quotes in Other Supplementary Documents.
- Materials/Publications/Other: ~$20,000 (1–2%)
  - Documentation, printing, modest licenses not covered elsewhere.
- Indirect Costs (F&A): Remainder per rate (e.g., ~12–15% of MTDC)

Work Packages (cost‑to‑objective mapping)
- WP1 Governance & Security Enablement: policy docs, CODEOWNERS, signed releases, SBOM, incident response; external security audit; supply‑chain best practices.
- WP2 OSE Engineering Enablement: stabilization and maintainability improvements, release engineering for L0/MicroImpute/MicroCalibrate, typed APIs, documentation, tests. (No POSE funds for net‑new core features.)
- WP3 Local Microdata Operations: calibration runs for state/CD weights, validation dashboards, evaluation methods; preparation to accept external contributions. (Feature methods developed by community are out of POSE scope.)
- WP4 Community & Training: contributor onboarding, workshops, I‑Corps participation, partner pilots and user support materials.
- WP5 Evaluation & Documentation: metrics, reproducibility audits, independent evaluation subaward, PAPPG deliverables and dissemination.

Compliance Reminders
- Budget ≤ $1.5M (RWR).
- Upload quotes for equipment >$50k; consultant letters for >$50k; budget docs for subawards; IP allocation agreement (Phase II) for each subaward.
- No funds to non‑U.S. organizations; international collaborators may participate without NSF support.
- Keep POSE‑funded tasks focused on OSE operations and enablement; track any feature development as community‑contributed or separately supported.
