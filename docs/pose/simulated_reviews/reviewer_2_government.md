# POSE Phase II Review - Reviewer 2
**Reviewer Profile**: Former Government Official, Office of Management and Budget

## Overall Rating: Good (3.5/5)

### Summary
PolicyEngine addresses a critical need for transparent, accessible policy modeling tools. As someone who has worked with CBO, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Treasury models, I appreciate the value of open-source alternatives. However, the proposal has notable gaps in government engagement strategy and compliance considerations.

### Strengths
1. **Addresses real government needs**: Legislative offices already using the platform (Sen. Gounardes, Councilmember Parker) demonstrates product-market fit.

2. **Cost-effective alternative**: Government agencies spend millions on proprietary models. Open-source reduces costs and increases transparency.

3. **Strong validation methodology**: TAXSIM comparison provides confidence in accuracy. The 99.7% concordance is essential for credibility.

4. **UK government adoption**: HM Treasury's Algorithmic Transparency Record shows international government validation.

### Weaknesses
1. **Insufficient government partnership strategy**: How will you navigate procurement processes? What about FedRAMP compliance for federal adoption?

2. **Missing discussion of official scoring**: CBO and JCT have statutory roles. How does PolicyEngine complement rather than compete?

3. **Data access limitations**: Many government microsimulation models use restricted data (IRS, SSA). How will you handle this disadvantage?

4. **Political neutrality concerns**: How will you maintain credibility across partisan divides? No discussion of governance safeguards.

5. **Sustainability depends heavily on government contracts**: But no clear path to procurement success.

### Specific Government Concerns

**Data Quality and Access**
- Current Population Survey enhancements are good but insufficient for tax modeling
- No access to administrative data limits accuracy for high-income households
- State-level calibration methodology needs validation against state revenue data

**Regulatory Compliance**
- No mention of Section 508 accessibility compliance
- FISMA security requirements not addressed
- Privacy Act considerations for storing household scenarios missing

**Intergovernmental Coordination**
- How will you coordinate with state revenue departments?
- No discussion of NASBO, NCSL, or NGA partnerships
- Federal-state-local data sharing agreements needed

### Broader Impacts Assessment
The democratization goal is admirable but raises concerns:
- Could enable misleading "dynamic scoring" by advocacy groups
- Risk of oversimplified analyses driving policy debates
- Need quality control mechanisms for published analyses

### Sustainability Analysis
Revenue projections seem optimistic:
- Government contracting timeline typically 18-24 months
- Philanthropic funding may decrease if seen as government substitute
- Commercial integration revenue uncertain

### Technical Assessment
Strong technical foundation but gaps for government use:
- Batch processing capabilities for large-scale analyses unclear
- Version control and reproducibility good but need audit trails
- Documentation meets academic but not government standards

### Recommendations for Funding
1. **Require government advisory board** with representatives from federal, state, local agencies
2. **Mandate compliance roadmap** for FedRAMP, Section 508, FISMA
3. **Establish data partnership strategy** with Census, BLS, state agencies
4. **Create quality assurance framework** for published analyses
5. **Develop government-specific documentation** meeting agency requirements

### Critical Questions for Applicants
1. How will you handle conflicting results with official scores?
2. What safeguards prevent partisan capture of the platform?
3. How do you plan to access restricted government microdata?
4. What is your strategy for state and local government adoption?
5. How will you maintain neutrality while accepting advocacy funding?

### Positive Observations
- MyFriendBen integration shows practical application beyond policy analysis
- International expansion (UK, Canada) demonstrates scalability
- Academic partnerships (NBER, USC, Georgetown) provide credibility
- Modular architecture enables government-specific deployments

### Risk Assessment
- **High**: Reputational risk if analyses prove significantly wrong
- **Medium**: Sustainability risk if government adoption slower than projected
- **Medium**: Competition from well-funded initiatives (CBO transparency efforts)
- **Low**: Technical risk given demonstrated platform maturity

## Recommendation: Fund with significant conditions

### Conditions for Funding
1. Establish Government Advisory Committee within 6 months
2. Submit compliance roadmap for federal requirements within 3 months
3. Demonstrate state government partnership by Year 1 review
4. Implement quality assurance framework for published analyses
5. Report quarterly on government engagement metrics

### Final Comments
This proposal has merit but underestimates the complexity of government adoption. The technical platform is sound, but success requires navigating procurement, compliance, and political challenges not adequately addressed. The team should partner with organizations experienced in government technology adoption.

The $1.5M budget seems appropriate, though the $80K for UX research might be better spent on government compliance consulting. The indirect rate of 15% is reasonable for a fiscal sponsor arrangement.

I support funding with the understanding that government adoption will require significant additional effort beyond what's described in this proposal.
