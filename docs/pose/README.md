POSE Phase 2 — Docs

Use this folder for the Phase 2 application artifacts we will actively edit in markdown for word‑count tracking and assembly (modeled after `../atlas`).

Suggested layout
- `responses/`: One markdown file per narrative answer.
- `pose_questions.yaml`: Structured list of questions, word limits, and file paths.
- `assembled.md`: Generated application view with per‑section word counts and statuses (output of scripts).

Guidelines
- Author answers in markdown (no headings inside answers unless required). The assembler will add headings and word‑count badges.
- Keep within specified word limits. The scripts will flag over‑limit sections and missing files.
