### Vision and Need
Our long-term vision is a secure, community-governed open-source ecosystem for transparent analysis of tax-and-transfer policies that supports timely, reproducible insights for decision-makers and the public. The societal need is clear: fiscal and social policy debates frequently rely on proprietary models that limit scrutiny, reproducibility, and open access. An open, well-governed OSE lowers barriers to participation and accelerates evidence-based policymaking.

### Product and Maturity
We are transitioning an existing open-source microsimulation product with an active user base into a sustainable OSE. The product supports configurable tax/benefit rules, dataset adapters, and reporting pipelines. It has external usage in research, journalism, and policy analysis. Current development follows open practices (issues/PRs, CI, releases), and we will formalize these into a durable ecosystem.

### Guiding Principles
We ground the OSE in four practical commitments. First, transparency: all rules, assumptions, and model code are public, and analyses are reproducible end‑to‑end. Second, security and quality: we integrate supply‑chain safeguards, code review, testing, and disciplined release hygiene. Third, open participation: we make contributor pathways explicit and supported with documentation and mentorship so new maintainers can join and succeed. Finally, sustainability: we establish governance and funding practices that allow the ecosystem to operate as durable public infrastructure.

### Anticipated Broader Impacts
Broader impacts include democratized access to policy analysis, improved reproducibility in applied economics, accelerated policy learning cycles, and contributor upskilling in secure open-source practices. Government and civil society benefit from a shared, auditable modeling base.

### Pointer to Open-Source Product
Per solicitation, we will include a formal citation to the public repository in References Cited and avoid URLs in the Project Description body. The citation will identify the repository, versioned releases, and key artifacts.

### Phase I Context and I‑Corps Plan
We received a Phase I award in August 2025. Because that was on the registration deadline for the August cohort, we will participate in the January I‑Corps for POSE cohort. Team: PI, co‑PI, and an external OSE mentor (named in the personnel list). Commitment: ~41 hours per team member plus 100 interviews (mentor not required to interview beyond kickoff). Outputs will directly feed finalization of governance policies, contributor onboarding, and the security plan.

### Modular Architecture and Current Components
To support sustained community development, we have separated core capabilities into focused packages with independent lifecycles. L0 provides PyTorch L0/L0+L2 regularization and gating primitives for differentiable sparsity and feature selection in calibration workflows. MicroImpute offers quantile regression forest imputation alongside baseline methods with benchmarking based on quantile‑loss. MicroCalibrate implements gradient‑descent reweighting to match administrative targets for state and congressional districts; it integrates L0 sparsity via Hard Concrete gates, supports hyperparameter tuning and holdout robustness checks, and supersedes our earlier prototype. These methods underpin our enhanced microdata and calibration work (Ghenis & Woodruff 2024). Each package is documented, tested, and versioned so contributors can work in well‑scoped areas that roll up to the broader OSE.

### Solicitation Alignment (Phase II Requirements Coverage)
This narrative covers all Phase II elements. The Context of OSE establishes vision, need, current status, novelty, and team qualifications and points to public repositories via References Cited. Ecosystem Establishment/Growth describes discovery, engagement of users and contributors, partner recruitment, milestones, and metrics. Organization and Governance explains licensing, decision‑making, working groups, and accountability. Continuous Development Model details open, distributed development with CI/testing, releases, and backports. The Risk Analysis/Security Plan addresses access control, secure SDLC, SBOM and signed releases, incident response, provenance, and privacy. Community Building outlines onboarding, mentorship, support, and recognition. Sustainability covers both financial and operational sustainment. Evaluation Plan and Metrics specifies adoption, quality, security, and calibration metrics and how we will measure them. Required attachments will be provided per PAPPG: letters of collaboration from current users and contributors, the Project Personnel/Collaborators list, the budget and justification, Facilities/Other Resources, a two‑page Data Management & Sharing Plan, SciENcv biosketches for senior personnel, Current and Pending (Other) Support, and any required documentation for equipment, consultants, and subawards in Phase II.
