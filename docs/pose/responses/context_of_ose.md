### Vision and Need
Our long-term vision is to establish PolicyEngine as the foundational open-source ecosystem for transparent, reproducible tax-and-transfer policy analysis—serving as critical infrastructure for evidence-based decision-making across government, academia, and civil society. The societal need is urgent and quantifiable: current policy debates rely heavily on proprietary models (Urban-Brookings TPC at $3.2M annual operating costs, Penn Wharton Budget Model at $1.8M annually) that remain black boxes to researchers and the public. Initial stakeholder conversations suggest that most policy analysts at state and local levels lack access to microsimulation capabilities, with cost and transparency being primary barriers. Recent high-stakes policy decisions—from the $1.9T American Rescue Plan to $369B climate investments in the Inflation Reduction Act—highlighted the democratic deficit when only 12 well-resourced institutions can independently verify distributional impact claims. An open, well-governed OSE transforms this landscape by reducing analysis costs to zero while maintaining institutional-grade accuracy, enabling any organization to conduct sophisticated analysis, validate findings, and contribute improvements that benefit the entire policy community.

### Product and Maturity
PolicyEngine has achieved significant product-market fit with documented usage metrics: [PLACEHOLDER: verify monthly active users], [PLACEHOLDER: verify API call volume], and institutional adoption across [PLACEHOLDER: verify deployment count] named deployments spanning legislative offices (U.S. Joint Economic Committee, NY State Senator Gounardes, D.C. Councilmember Parker), federal agencies (HM Treasury Algorithmic Transparency Record ATR-2024-007), and major policy institutions (NBER MOU signed August 2025, Niskanen Center partnership, UK Cabinet Office integration). **Current technical capabilities include**: (1) Comprehensive model coverage of [PLACEHOLDER: verify tax provision count] federal tax provisions, [PLACEHOLDER: verify state count] state tax systems, and [PLACEHOLDER: verify benefit program count] major benefit programs (SNAP, WIC, TANF, housing assistance, Medicaid) with parameter-level validation; (2) Performance optimization achieving [PLACEHOLDER: verify API response time] API response times for household calculations and [PLACEHOLDER: verify runtime] runtimes for 50-state microsimulations; (3) Quality assurance with [PLACEHOLDER: verify parameter count] policy parameters under [PLACEHOLDER: verify test coverage] test coverage, automated regression testing, and formal TAXSIM validation showing [PLACEHOLDER: verify agreement rate] agreement across [PLACEHOLDER: verify scenario count] test scenarios (with ongoing improvements planned). **International expansion demonstrates ecosystem readiness**: Canada model covers federal and provincial/territorial tax and benefit programs (though Canadian data restrictions require exploring US microdata calibration methods); early prototype models exist in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Israel, and Nigeria; Germany collaboration with GETTSIM team positions us to share microdata calibration innovations. The technical foundation comprises [PLACEHOLDER: verify package count] modular packages (policyengine-core, country-specific packages, API, web app, data enhancement tools) with comprehensive CI/CD pipelines, semantic versioning, and signed releases—demonstrating production readiness for community governance.

### Guiding Principles
We ground the OSE in four practical commitments. First, transparency: all rules, assumptions, and model code are public, and analyses are reproducible end‑to‑end. Second, security and quality: we integrate supply‑chain safeguards, code review, testing, and disciplined release hygiene. Third, open participation: we make contributor pathways explicit and supported with documentation and mentorship so new maintainers can join and succeed. Finally, sustainability: we establish governance and funding practices that allow the ecosystem to operate as durable public infrastructure.

### Anticipated Broader Impacts
Broader impacts include democratized access to policy analysis, improved reproducibility in applied economics, accelerated policy learning cycles, and contributor upskilling in secure open-source practices. Government and civil society benefit from a shared, auditable modeling base.

### Pointer to Open-Source Product
Per solicitation, we will include a formal citation to the public repository in References Cited and avoid URLs in the Project Description body. The citation will identify the repository, versioned releases, and key artifacts.

### Phase I Context and I‑Corps Plan
We received a Phase I award (#2434925) two weeks ago to conduct ecosystem discovery and planning. Having just received the award after the August cohort registration deadline, we will participate in the January 2026 I‑Corps for POSE cohort. Our team consists of Max Ghenis (PI/Entrepreneurial Lead), Nikhil Woodruff (co‑PI/Technical Lead), and Dan Feenberg (NBER/Industry Mentor with 30+ years maintaining TAXSIM). **Phase I will explore key questions through stakeholder interviews** including: (1) Whether government analysts prefer modular, API-accessible tools over monolithic desktop applications; (2) What level of audit trails and approval workflows are required for policy parameter changes; (3) What documentation and onboarding improvements would reduce adoption barriers. The intensive I‑Corps program requires approximately 41 hours per team member conducting 100+ customer discovery interviews across stakeholder segments: state/federal policy analysts, academic researchers, think tank economists, journalists, civic technologists, and potential commercial adopters. Interview insights will directly inform three critical Phase II deliverables: (1) governance structures balancing openness with quality control (RFC process, steering committee composition, release approval workflows); (2) contributor onboarding pathways reducing time-to-first-contribution from current average [PLACEHOLDER: verify current time] to target [PLACEHOLDER: verify target time]; and (3) security practices meeting government deployment standards (FedRAMP Moderate equivalency, SOC 2 Type II compliance pathway) while maintaining development velocity.

### Modular Architecture and Technical Innovation
Our architecture separates concerns into independently maintainable packages with clear interfaces, enabling distributed innovation while maintaining system coherence. **Current technical capabilities demonstrate**: (1) **L0 sparsity optimization** implements differentiable sparsity through Hard Concrete gates, achieving [PLACEHOLDER: verify weight reduction] weight reduction in state-level calibration tasks while maintaining [PLACEHOLDER: verify accuracy degradation] target accuracy degradation, reducing computational requirements by [PLACEHOLDER: verify performance improvement]; (2) **MicroImpute QRF framework** employs quantile regression forests to preserve distributional characteristics during imputation, outperforming mean-based methods by [PLACEHOLDER: verify improvement percentage] on held-out quantile loss metrics across demographic variables, enabling state-level analysis from national CPS data; (3) **MicroCalibrate optimization engine** combines Adam optimizer with administrative target matching, achieving convergence on 50-state calibrations in [PLACEHOLDER: verify convergence time] (versus [PLACEHOLDER: verify baseline time] with traditional raking methods), with loss reduction to [PLACEHOLDER: verify tolerance] tolerance. These capabilities support creation of the Enhanced CPS with validated state identifiers and congressional district weights matching Census ACS totals within [PLACEHOLDER: verify error rate] mean absolute error. **Demonstrated ecosystem traction**: Yale Budget Lab adopted our quantile regression forest imputation method after PolicyEngine presented it at the National Tax Association meeting; USC CESR researchers are using PolicyEngine for marginal tax rate and benefit cliff analysis (with PolicyEngine's availability unlocking Matthew Unrath's IRP/HHS grant opportunity); Urban Institute explored integration for TRIM3 model validation. Each package maintains comprehensive documentation, [PLACEHOLDER: verify test coverage] test coverage, semantic versioning, and PyPI distribution with [PLACEHOLDER: verify download count] monthly downloads—demonstrating infrastructure readiness for community governance.
