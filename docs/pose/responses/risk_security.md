## Risk Analysis and Security Plan

PolicyEngine implements comprehensive security practices aligned with CISA/NSA guidance for securing software supply chains. Our multi-layered approach addresses technical vulnerabilities, data privacy, and ecosystem integrity.

### Security Architecture and Practices

**Supply Chain Security**: Automated scanning with Dependabot identifies vulnerabilities within 24 hours of disclosure. We maintain a 48-hour patch deployment target for critical vulnerabilities, with automated CI/CD pipelines ensuring rapid, tested updates.

**Code Integrity**: All commits require GPG signing for verification. Pull requests undergo automated security scanning before merge, including static analysis (CodeQL), dependency auditing, and license compliance checks. The two-reviewer requirement for core components ensures human oversight of security-critical changes.

**Incident Response Protocol**: 
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts security team within 15 minutes of anomalies
2. **Triage**: Security lead assesses severity using CVSS scoring within 2 hours
3. **Response**: Critical issues trigger immediate patch development and user notification
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure through GitHub Security Advisories and direct stakeholder communication
5. **Post-mortem**: Public incident reports document lessons learned and process improvements

**Vulnerability Management**: We maintain a responsible disclosure program with defined communication channels (security@policyengine.org), recognition for security researchers, and a 90-day disclosure timeline for non-critical issues. The security team includes members across time zones ensuring 24-hour response capability.

### Data Privacy and Protection

**No Personal Data Storage**: PolicyEngine's architecture fundamentally protects privacyâ€”we process calculations without storing personal information. API calls contain only hypothetical household parameters, never identifying information. This design eliminates data breach risks while enabling full functionality.

**Audit Logging**: All API access generates anonymized audit logs tracking usage patterns without user identification. Rate limiting prevents abuse while preserving open access for legitimate research. Geographic distribution through CloudFlare protects against DDoS attacks.

**Compliance Framework**: Although we don't process personal data, we maintain GDPR-compliant practices for any incidental information. Terms of service explicitly prohibit submission of real personal data. Educational materials emphasize using representative rather than actual household data.

### Technical Risk Mitigation

**Validation Infrastructure**: Our continuous validation against TAXSIM, CBO projections, and state revenue estimates ensures calculation accuracy. With 8,600 automated test cases across our US and UK models covering edge conditions and complex interactions, we maintain rigorous quality standards. Version control enables rollback within minutes if issues emerge.

**Performance and Scalability**: Load testing before major releases ensures stability. Horizontal scaling on Google Cloud Platform handles demand spikes. Database query optimization and Redis caching maintain fast API response times. Regional CDN deployment ensures global accessibility.

**Dependency Management**: We minimize external dependencies, vendoring critical libraries when appropriate. Automated license scanning ensures compliance with open-source obligations. Regular dependency pruning removes unused packages that could introduce vulnerabilities.

### Organizational Risk Management

**Distributed Leadership**: No single point of failure in governance or technical leadership. Each core component has multiple maintainers across institutions. Documented succession plans ensure continuity. Institutional partnerships (NBER, USC, Georgetown) provide organizational resilience.

**Financial Resilience**: Revenue diversification across government contracts, educational licensing, and philanthropic support prevents funding concentration. Six-month operating reserve target provides runway during transitions. Low-overhead remote operations maximize resource efficiency.

**Community Health**: Clear code of conduct based on Contributor Covenant ensures inclusive environment. Conflict resolution procedures address disputes before escalation. Regular community surveys identify emerging issues. Transparent roadmap planning prevents surprise changes that fragment community.

### Ecosystem Security

**Contributor Vetting**: While maintaining open contribution, we implement graduated permissions. New contributors start with documentation and test improvements. Code contributions require review by two core maintainers. Commit access granted only after sustained quality contributions.

**Fork Management**: Clear governance ensures community cohesion, but we prepare for potential forks. Apache 2.0 licensing preserves user rights while requiring attribution. Modular architecture allows component-level forking without ecosystem fragmentation. Regular community engagement prevents divergence motivations.

**Malicious Use Prevention**: While we cannot prevent all misuse, we implement safeguards:
- Documentation emphasizes uncertainty and limitations
- API responses include confidence intervals and assumptions
- Training materials stress ethical analysis practices
- Community guidelines prohibit misleading advocacy
- Public corrections for identified misrepresentations

### Quality Assurance

**Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive code coverage with emphasis on critical paths. Integration tests validate full calculation pipelines. Property-based testing identifies edge cases. Regression tests prevent previously fixed bugs from recurring.

**External Audits**: Annual security audits by independent firms. Quarterly validation against government models. Academic peer review of methodological changes. Public bug bounty program incentivizes vulnerability discovery.

**Monitoring and Alerting**: Real-time monitoring of API performance, error rates, and usage patterns. Automated alerts for anomalies or degradation. Weekly security metrics review. Monthly security posture assessment.

### Specific Phase II Security Enhancements

**Year 1 Priorities**:
- Establish Security Champions program across contributor organizations
- Deploy hardware security module for release signing
- Implement comprehensive vulnerability disclosure program
- Enhance automated testing coverage

**Year 2 Goals**:
- Formal threat modeling with STRIDE methodology
- Independent security audit publication
- Multi-factor authentication for all maintainers
- Automated compliance monitoring

### Metrics and Accountability

We track security effectiveness through concrete metrics:
- Mean time to patch: Target < 48 hours for critical vulnerabilities
- Security Champion coverage: 100% of core components
- Incident response time: < 2 hours for initial triage
- Vulnerability disclosure handling: 100% acknowledged within 48 hours
- Security training completion: 100% of maintainers annually
- Dependency currency: Regular updates within reasonable timeframes

This comprehensive security approach ensures PolicyEngine remains trustworthy infrastructure for critical policy analysis while maintaining the openness essential for community-driven development.
