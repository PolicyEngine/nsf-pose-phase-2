### Comprehensive Threat Model and Risk Assessment

**Supply Chain Security Threats** (with specific mitigation strategies):
- **Dependency Compromise**: Malicious packages in PyPI/npm with similar names to legitimate dependencies
  - Mitigation: Dependency pinning with cryptographic hashes, private package mirrors for critical dependencies
  - Detection: Automated vulnerability scanning with Snyk and GitHub Dependabot, SBOM analysis for unexpected changes
- **Typosquatting Attacks**: Adversaries registering packages with names similar to PolicyEngine components
  - Mitigation: Proactive registration of common typos, trademark protection for PolicyEngine namespace
  - Monitoring: Daily scanning of package registries for PolicyEngine-related names
- **Malicious Contributions**: Backdoors or vulnerabilities introduced through legitimate-appearing pull requests
  - Mitigation: Mandatory code review by 2+ maintainers, automated static analysis, contributor background verification
  - Detection: Behavioral analysis of contributor patterns, anomaly detection in code changes

**Data Security and Privacy Risks**:
- **Data Leakage**: Sensitive microdata exposed through logs, debug output, or cached results
  - Mitigation: Structured logging with automatic PII redaction, secure debug modes, encrypted cache storage
  - Compliance: GDPR Article 25 (privacy by design), HIPAA administrative safeguards where applicable
- **Model Inversion Attacks**: Adversaries inferring sensitive information from model outputs
  - Mitigation: Differential privacy mechanisms (ε<1.0), k-anonymity enforcement (k≥5), output perturbation
  - Monitoring: Statistical disclosure control validation, automated privacy budget tracking

**Infrastructure and Operational Risks**:
- **Reproducibility Drift**: Gradual divergence in calculation results across environments or versions
  - Mitigation: Deterministic build processes, containerized environments, cryptographic result validation
  - Detection: Automated regression testing, historical result comparison, statistical significance testing
- **Availability Threats**: DDoS attacks, resource exhaustion, or service disruption
  - Mitigation: CloudFlare DDoS protection, rate limiting, graceful degradation patterns
  - Monitoring: Real-time performance metrics, automated alerting, failover procedures

### Comprehensive Security Implementation Plan

**Identity and Access Management (Zero-Trust Architecture)**:
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn) required for all maintainers, backup TOTP tokens
- **Role-Based Access Control**: 
  - Read-only: Community contributors, external researchers
  - Write: Trusted contributors with 6+ month track record and maintainer sponsorship
  - Admin: Core team members with release signing privileges, 2-person approval for changes
  - Security: Dedicated security team with incident response authority
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Granular permissions for GitHub, cloud resources, and package registries
- **Access Reviews**: Quarterly access audits, automatic deprovisioning after 90 days of inactivity

**Secure Development Lifecycle (NIST SSDF Framework)**:
- **Threat Modeling**: Annual STRIDE analysis of PolicyEngine architecture, quarterly updates for major changes
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**:
  - Bandit for Python security issues, Semgrep for custom security patterns
  - SonarCloud for code quality and security debt tracking
  - CodeQL for semantic code analysis and vulnerability detection
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**:
  - OWASP ZAP integration for web application security testing
  - API security testing with custom PolicyEngine-specific test cases
  - Fuzzing with OSS-Fuzz for input validation testing
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**:
  - Snyk for dependency vulnerability scanning with automatic remediation
  - FOSSA for license compliance and security risk assessment
  - Custom tooling for PolicyEngine-specific dependency analysis

**Release Security and Integrity**:
- **Code Signing**: GPG signatures on all release tags and artifacts using hardware security modules
- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**: SPDX 2.3 format with complete dependency graph and vulnerability status
- **Reproducible Builds**: Hermetic build environment with deterministic output verification
- **Release Verification**: Multi-party signature validation, automated integrity checking

**Incident Response and Security Operations**:
- **Security Response Team**: Dedicated security@policyengine.org with 24/7 monitoring, escalation procedures
- **Vulnerability Disclosure Program**:
  - Private reporting channel with GPG encryption
  - 90-day coordinated disclosure timeline (expedited for critical issues)
  - Security advisory publication with CVE assignment and CVSS scoring
- **Incident Classification and SLAs**:
  - Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0): 4-hour response, 24-hour remediation target
  - High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): 24-hour response, 72-hour remediation target
  - Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): 72-hour response, 2-week remediation target
- **Communication Protocols**: Security mailing list, GitHub Security Advisories, public blog posts for major incidents

### Data Governance, Provenance, and Privacy Framework

**Data Provenance and Lineage Tracking**:
- **Dataset Provenance**: Complete audit trail from original data sources (Census, BLS, IRS) through all transformations
- **Cryptographic Verification**: SHA-256 checksums for all data files, Merkle trees for large dataset integrity
- **Version Control**: Git-based tracking of all policy parameter changes with legislative citations and effective dates
- **Build Reproducibility**: Deterministic data processing pipelines with locked dependency versions and container images

**Policy Parameter Audit Trail**:
- **Legislative Mapping**: Direct links from code parameters to USC sections, CFR regulations, and state statutes
- **Change Attribution**: Git blame integration showing policy expert responsible for each parameter modification
- **Validation Chain**: Cross-references to authoritative sources (IRS publications, state tax agency guidance)
- **Temporal Accuracy**: Effective date tracking for all policy changes with retroactive application capabilities

**Privacy-by-Design Architecture**:
- **Data Segregation**: Clear separation between public code repositories and sensitive microdata processing environments
- **Local Processing Frameworks**: Documentation and tooling for organizations to run PolicyEngine on sensitive data locally
- **Anonymization Standards**:
  - k-anonymity with k≥5 for all public data releases
  - Differential privacy with ε<1.0 for statistical aggregations
  - Suppression rules for cells with <10 observations
