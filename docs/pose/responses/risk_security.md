### Threat Model and Risks
We take a conservative view of the supply chain and assume adversaries may attempt dependency compromise, typosquatting, or malicious contributions. We also plan for data‑handling mistakes—such as leakage via logs or build artifacts—and for integrity risks like reproducibility drift or insecure release artifacts. The plan below addresses those risks with concrete, auditable practices.

### Security Plan
Identity and access management is based on least‑privilege roles, two‑factor authentication, scoped secrets, and periodic access reviews. The secure development lifecycle includes code review, static and dynamic analysis, and dependency pinning and scanning. We publish a SBOM for each release and sign artifacts. Incident response uses a private reporting channel, simple SLAs for triage and fixes, and a disclosure workflow aligned with CISA/NSA guidance (CISA & NSA 2022) and OpenSSF best practices.

### Quality, Provenance, and Privacy
Every dataset and ruleset includes provenance, and build artifacts are checksummed so releases are traceable and reproducible. Policy rule changes leave an audit trail that reviewers can follow. We keep code and sensitive data separate by design, offer practical guidance on lawful and ethical data use, and consult IRBs where appropriate when human data is involved.
