### Governance Model
The OSE is run by a small steering group consisting of the PI, co‑PI, and community maintainers. This group sets the roadmap and release train and convenes a public RFC process whenever changes have broad impact. Work happens in lightweight working groups—modeling, data, infrastructure, and documentation—each with a short charter and rotating facilitation so leadership and institutional knowledge grow beyond the core team.

### Licensing
We will use an open‑source license chosen to maximize downstream adoption and remove friction for partners. Policies for data adapters and third‑party dependencies are documented and consistently applied. Depending on the contribution pathway, we will use a Developer Certificate of Origin or contributor agreement that is simple, well understood, and friendly to institutional contributors.

### Decision‑making and Accountability
Roadmaps, issues, design notes, and decisions are public by default, with review thresholds stated in advance so contributors know how to propose and land changes. A clear code of conduct and conflict‑of‑interest policy set expectations for collaboration. Security reports flow through a dedicated private channel with responsible‑disclosure timelines and a security advisory process tied to signed releases.

### Sustainability Structures
For financial operations, we will work through a fiscal sponsor or foundation partner so we can transparently receive funds, publish budget priorities, and report on spending and results. These structures turn good intentions into routines that persist across staff changes and funding cycles.
