# Conclusion

PolicyEngine stands at a critical inflection point. We have proven that open-source microsimulation can match proprietary alternatives in accuracy while dramatically expanding access. Government adoption from the Joint Economic Committee to the UK Cabinet Office validates our technical approach. Growing interest from benefits platforms in migrating from closed-source alternatives demonstrates market demand. Serving over 100,000 people per year through our API and partners, with rapid growth as partnerships scale, we have achieved product-market fit.

Now we must transform this momentum into a self-sustaining ecosystem. NSF POSE Phase II funding provides the crucial catalyst for this transition, enabling us to formalize governance structures, establish contributor pathways, and build the training infrastructure necessary for long-term sustainability.

## The Path Forward

Our Phase II plan directly addresses the requirements for a successful open-source ecosystem. We will establish a formal governance structure transitioning from PSL Foundation fiscal sponsorship to an independent 501(c)(3) with representation from government users, academic researchers, and technical maintainers. This structure ensures community ownership while maintaining technical excellence.

The distributed development model already emerging—with UK developers contributing local authority features, USC researchers adding benefit cliff analyses, and multiple organizations building on our API—will be formalized through clear contribution guidelines, mentorship programs, and modular architecture that enables specialized communities to maintain components while ensuring system coherence.

Our sustainability model combines diverse revenue streams: state government consortiums, educational licensing, commercial API access, and philanthropic support. Unlike projects dependent on single funding sources, PolicyEngine builds resilience through multiple stakeholder communities, each with incentives for continued support.

## Why NSF Investment Matters Now

The timing for NSF investment is critical. The policy landscape is experiencing unprecedented change—pandemic-era program expansions, state-level experimentation with guaranteed income, federal tax credit modifications—yet most decision-makers lack tools to analyze these changes. The current migration of benefits navigators from proprietary to open-source platforms creates a unique window to establish PolicyEngine as the standard infrastructure.

Our participation in the January 2026 I-Corps cohort will refine our ecosystem strategy based on systematic stakeholder discovery. The overlap with our Phase I period through July 2026 enables immediate application of I-Corps insights while maintaining momentum. Beginning Phase II in May 2026 ensures continuity of effort during this critical growth phase.

NSF support provides more than funding—it validates PolicyEngine as research infrastructure worthy of public investment. This credibility accelerates government adoption, attracts academic contributors, and signals long-term viability to potential users currently hesitant about open-source sustainability.

## Transformative Potential

PolicyEngine's success will fundamentally reshape policy analysis infrastructure. Instead of twelve institutions controlling microsimulation capability, thousands of organizations will analyze policies affecting their communities. Instead of students learning from textbooks, they will use the same tools analyzing real legislation. Instead of families missing benefits due to complexity, community organizations will identify eligibility using transparent, validated calculations.

The ecosystem model we establish becomes a template for other policy technology domains. By demonstrating that open-source development can produce mission-critical government infrastructure, we influence broader adoption of transparent, community-driven approaches to public technology.

## Commitment to Success

Our team brings unique qualifications to execute this vision. Max Ghenis combines Google Analytics experience with MIT policy training and PolicyEngine's founding vision. Nikhil Woodruff's technical leadership and current UK Cabinet Office secondment demonstrates our platform's government-readiness. Pavel Makarchuk bridges U.S. and international implementations. Dan Feenberg's three decades maintaining TAXSIM provides unmatched expertise in microsimulation sustainability.

Our institutional partners amplify these capabilities. NBER's network reaches hundreds of economists ready to adopt open tools. USC's Center for Economic and Social Research validates our methods through HHS-funded research. Georgetown's Better Government Lab channels student energy into platform improvements. MyFriendBen's benefits navigation demonstrates real-world impact at scale; MyFriendBen reports screening over 40,000 Colorado households in its first two years with a median monthly benefit value of $1,500 (MyFriendBen, 2025).

## A Call to Action

The question is not whether policy analysis infrastructure should be democratized—the concentration of capability in elite institutions while states use Excel for billion-dollar programs is clearly unsustainable. The question is whether we seize this moment to establish open-source microsimulation as the foundation for evidence-based policymaking.

With NSF POSE Phase II support, PolicyEngine will become the open infrastructure that enables any organization to analyze how policies affect their communities. We will train thousands of new policy analysts, identify billions in unclaimed benefits, and ensure that policy decisions reflect evidence rather than ideology. Most importantly, we will prove that critical government infrastructure can be transparent, community-driven, and accessible to all.

The broader impacts extend beyond immediate users. By establishing sustainable open-source models for policy technology, we influence how society develops and maintains public goods in the digital age. By training diverse cohorts in microsimulation methods, we reshape who participates in policy analysis. By exposing model assumptions and calculations, we strengthen democratic accountability.

PolicyEngine is ready for this next phase. Our technical foundation is solid, our user community is growing, and our vision for democratized policy analysis resonates across political divides. With NSF's partnership, we will build the open-source ecosystem that transforms tax-benefit microsimulation from proprietary privilege to public infrastructure, ensuring that evidence-based policymaking becomes accessible to all who seek to improve their communities.

The future of policy analysis is open, transparent, and community-driven. With POSE Phase II support, PolicyEngine will make that future a reality.
