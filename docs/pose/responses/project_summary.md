# Project Summary

## Overview
PolicyEngine proposes to establish an open-source ecosystem (OSE) for tax-benefit microsimulation, democratizing access to policy analysis tools currently restricted to elite institutions. Building on Phase I award #2434925 and proven adoption by the Joint Economic Committee and UK Cabinet Office, we will develop governance, training infrastructure, and contributor pathways to sustain this critical public infrastructure. Our platform enables any organization—state legislatures, universities, benefits navigators—to analyze how policies affect constituents. With 9,034 parameters and variables backed by 1,800+ government citations, PolicyEngine transforms the landscape by providing free, transparent microsimulation matching institutional-grade accuracy.

## Intellectual Merit
This project advances computational social science through three innovations: (1) Models validated against TAXSIM (Feenberg & Coutts, 1993) with 8,600 test cases while exposing every calculation step for verification; (2) Modular architecture separating rules engines, data enhancement, and analysis tools, enabling specialized communities to maintain components; (3) Shareable analysis links with full parameters enabling exact replication. Our GitHub organization demonstrates ecosystem viability with 146 repositories, 50,000+ commits, and 30+ contributors. The 3x acceleration in development (60 new repos in 2025 vs 16 in 2023) and 1,227 open issues show genuine distributed development already underway.

## Broader Impacts
PolicyEngine democratizes policy analysis through four pathways. First, organizations excluded from microsimulation gain sophisticated analytical capabilities, with USC researchers using PolicyEngine for marginal tax rate research requiring open access. Second, curriculum modules for economics programs ensure students learn using tools analyzing real legislation. Third, our MyFriendBen partnership (MyFriendBen, 2025) identified $800M in unclaimed benefits for 50,000 Colorado families, demonstrating immediate social impact. Fourth, state government partnerships address massive unmet demand where most safety net programs are administered but analytical capacity remains minimal. By training diverse cohorts including community colleges and MSIs, we reshape who participates in policy analysis. The platform serves 100,000+ people annually through our API, with international expansion to six countries demonstrating global applicability.
