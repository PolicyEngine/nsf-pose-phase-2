Overview
PolicyEngine proposes to establish a sustainable and robust open‑source ecosystem (OSE) that supports community‑driven, distributed development and deployment of transparent tax‑and‑benefit microsimulation. We will transition an already deployed open‑source product into a well‑governed ecosystem with security, privacy, and contributor pathways that enable adoption across academia, government, and civil society.

Intellectual Merit
The project advances the state of open policy microsimulation by combining validated rules (federal/state tax and major benefits), enhanced microdata (imputation via quantile regression forests), and gradient‑descent reweighting (MicroCalibrate, optionally with L0 sparsity). We formalize governance, quality controls, and supply‑chain security to enable reproducible, high‑fidelity analysis and faster policy learning cycles.

Broader Impacts
Broader impacts include democratizing access to high‑quality policy analysis; improving transparency and reproducibility in applied economics; accelerating evidence‑based policymaking; and training contributors in secure, open development practices. We emphasize broad participation (onboarding, mentorship, documentation) and responsible data use through privacy‑preserving workflows.
