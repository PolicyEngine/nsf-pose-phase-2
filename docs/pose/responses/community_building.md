## Community Building

### User-Centric Community Strategy

PolicyEngine's community strategy prioritizes users—policy analysts, researchers, benefits counselors—over developers. While technical contributors are essential, our primary community consists of people using microsimulation for policy analysis, not building microsimulation software.

**User segments and engagement**:
- **Policy analysts**: Monthly webinars on modeling current legislation, peer support forums, direct access to PolicyEngine experts during office hours
- **Researchers**: Validation workshops comparing results across models, collaborative parameter updating, shared test case development
- **Benefits counselors**: Training on eligibility rules, simplified interfaces for client screening, community-maintained resource guides
- **Students**: Campus ambassadors, policy modeling competitions, summer research projects using real data

### Structured Support Programs

**Office hours** (timezone-distributed):
- Tuesday 2pm ET: State/local government focus
- Wednesday 6pm ET: Academic researchers and students  
- Thursday 10am PT: Benefits organizations and west coast users
- Format: 30-minute demo + 30-minute Q&A, recorded for asynchronous viewing

**Documentation by user type**:
- **Quickstart guides**: "Analyze a bill in 10 minutes" for legislators
- **Course materials**: Complete syllabi for instructors
- **API cookbooks**: Code examples for developers
- **Validation guides**: Comparison methods for researchers

### Building Bridges Across Communities

PolicyEngine connects previously isolated communities:
- **Researchers ↔ Policymakers**: USC research on benefit cliffs directly informing state legislation
- **UK ↔ US**: Nuffield-funded local modeling techniques adapted for US congressional districts
- **Academia ↔ Benefits access**: MyFriendBen using research-grade models for real-world eligibility

**Community events**:
- Annual conference rotating between DC (policy), NYC (finance), SF (tech)
- Regional workshops at NCSL, NTA, ASSA meetings
- Virtual hackathons focused on specific policy questions

### Contributor Recognition

- **Impact badges**: "Helped 10,000 families access benefits"
- **Research citations**: Papers using PolicyEngine acknowledged in release notes
- **Policy influence**: Dashboard tracking legislation analyzed using PolicyEngine
- **Career development**: Letters of recommendation, conference speaking opportunities
