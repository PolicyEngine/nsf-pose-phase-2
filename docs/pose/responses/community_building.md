### Evidence-Based Community Development Strategy

**User Research Foundation** (comprehensive stakeholder analysis with quantified insights):
- **Citizen Codex UX Study** (Nuffield Foundation funded): [PLACEHOLDER: verify interview count] stakeholder interviews across [PLACEHOLDER: verify archetype count] user archetypes, [PLACEHOLDER: verify session count] usability testing sessions, and comprehensive information architecture audit
- **Key Quantified Findings**:
  - [PLACEHOLDER: verify percentage] of policy analysts identify "getting started" documentation as primary adoption barrier
  - [PLACEHOLDER: verify percentage] prefer modular, API-accessible tools over monolithic desktop applications
  - [PLACEHOLDER: verify percentage] require audit trails for policy parameter changes, [PLACEHOLDER: verify percentage] need formal approval workflows
  - [PLACEHOLDER: verify improvement] improvement in task completion rate after navigation redesign
  - [PLACEHOLDER: verify increase] increase in ease-of-use ratings following terminology standardization
- **Archetype-Specific Insights**:
  - **Government Analysts**: Prioritize reliability, audit trails, and official data sources
  - **Academic Researchers**: Need reproducibility, citation support, and methodology transparency
  - **Journalists**: Require rapid turnaround, visualization tools, and fact-checking capabilities
  - **Policy Advocates**: Focus on accessibility, narrative storytelling, and distributional impact
  - **Technical Contributors**: Want clear contribution pathways, code quality standards, and recognition

**I-Corps Discovery Integration** ([PLACEHOLDER: verify interview count] customer interviews planned, January 2026):
- **Structured Interview Protocol**: [PLACEHOLDER: verify session length] sessions with standardized questions across [PLACEHOLDER: verify segment count] stakeholder segments
- **Geographic Distribution**: [PLACEHOLDER: verify federal percentage] federal/national, [PLACEHOLDER: verify state percentage] state/local, [PLACEHOLDER: verify academic percentage] academic, [PLACEHOLDER: verify international percentage] international
- **Pain Point Validation**: Quantitative ranking of adoption blockers, feature priorities, and willingness-to-pay analysis
- **Roadmap Prioritization**: Statistical analysis (conjoint analysis, MaxDiff) to rank feature development priorities
- **Public Roadmap Publication**: Quarterly updates with progress metrics, community voting on feature priorities

Onboarding meets people where they are, with first‑timer issues, clear contributor guides, a mentorship program, office hours, and starter projects that can be completed in a weekend. Recognition is built into releases and docs, with credits and lightweight badges, and we reserve small micro‑grants for documentation and adapters. Support lives on an open forum and chat, with quick responses to issues and pull requests, a monthly community call to keep momentum, and quarterly hackathons to welcome new contributors.

### Design Commitments (from UX Research)
We are turning research into visible changes. We will simplify navigation and policy organization so that common tasks (select a policy, set a timeframe, view distributional and budget results) are one or two clicks away. Policy naming will follow a consistent style guide and include search‑forward aliases (e.g., common nicknames for credits) to reduce confusion. The first‑run experience will offer example‑driven walkthroughs for analysts and non‑programmers, with copy‑to‑notebook snippets for those who prefer code. Feedback loops become explicit: the app will include a “suggest a fix” entry point that opens a pre‑filled issue with context, and the public roadmap will mark items that came from user studies so contributors see how their input moves work forward. To support international adopters (e.g., Canadian government teams), we will prioritize basic localization (bilingual documentation and UI strings) so contributors and users can work in their preferred language.
