### Community Strategy
Our community plan is deliberately simple. Discovery happens through the I‑Corps interviews and ongoing user research, and the results are reflected in a public roadmap that is kept current. In a recent UX study conducted by Citizen Codex (funded by the Nuffield Foundation) (Citizen Codex 2025), we combined stakeholder interviews, usability testing and observations, an audit of the current app, affinity mapping, and archetype analysis across policy analysts, economists, researchers, journalists, and novice users. The study surfaced strengths—open code, easy sharing, a non‑programmer UI, and rapid hypothesis testing—as well as pain points around navigation, policy organization and naming, and feedback loops. Those findings are driving concrete changes to information architecture, contributor onboarding, and example‑driven “first‑run” experiences.

Onboarding meets people where they are, with first‑timer issues, clear contributor guides, a mentorship program, office hours, and starter projects that can be completed in a weekend. Recognition is built into releases and docs, with credits and lightweight badges, and we reserve small micro‑grants for documentation and adapters. Support lives on an open forum and chat, with quick responses to issues and pull requests, a monthly community call to keep momentum, and quarterly hackathons to welcome new contributors.

### Design Commitments (from UX Research)
We are turning research into visible changes. We will simplify navigation and policy organization so that common tasks (select a policy, set a timeframe, view distributional and budget results) are one or two clicks away. Policy naming will follow a consistent style guide and include search‑forward aliases (e.g., common nicknames for credits) to reduce confusion. The first‑run experience will offer example‑driven walkthroughs for analysts and non‑programmers, with copy‑to‑notebook snippets for those who prefer code. Feedback loops become explicit: the app will include a “suggest a fix” entry point that opens a pre‑filled issue with context, and the public roadmap will mark items that came from user studies so contributors see how their input moves work forward.
