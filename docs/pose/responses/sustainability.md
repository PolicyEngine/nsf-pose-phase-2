## Sustainability Plan

### Diversified Revenue Model

PolicyEngine will achieve financial sustainability through multiple revenue streams while maintaining free access for public interest use:

**Government Consortiums** ($400K/year target):
- State consortium: 20 states at $15K/year for training, support, and priority features
- Federal partnerships: Grants for specific capabilities (CBO validation, administrative data integration)
- International collaboration: UK, Canada, Germany contributing to shared infrastructure

**Educational Licensing** ($200K/year target):
- University site licenses: $5K/year for enterprise features, priority support, student accounts
- Certification program: $200 per certificate for professionals and advanced students
- Curriculum licensing: Packaged courses for institutions without development capacity

**Commercial API Access** ($300K/year target):
- Tax software integration: Volume-based pricing for tax preparation firms
- Financial services: Banks and fintechs using for customer analysis
- Policy consulting: Enhanced SLAs and custom features for consultancies

**Philanthropic Support** ($600K/year ongoing):
- Program-specific grants: Benefits access, state capacity building, education initiatives
- General operating: Unrestricted funding from aligned foundations
- Individual giving: Annual campaign targeting PolicyEngine users

### Governance for Longevity

**Institutional anchoring**: NBER partnership provides long-term stability beyond individual founders. University partnerships (USC, Georgetown) ensure academic continuity.

**Technical sustainability**: Modular architecture allows distributed maintenance. Comprehensive documentation enables knowledge transfer. Automated testing prevents regression.

**Community resilience**: Multiple maintainers per component prevent single points of failure. Clear succession planning for all leadership roles. Documented governance processes survive personnel changes.
