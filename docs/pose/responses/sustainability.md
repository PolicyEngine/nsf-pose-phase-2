### Operational Sustainability
Sustainability is primarily an organizational practice, not a funding event. We distribute responsibility across working groups and community maintainers so no single person becomes a bottleneck. We lower onboarding costs through repeatable processes and documentation, and we set concrete targets for new maintainers and external pull requests so we can see progress. Each quarter we allocate time for “keep‑the‑lights‑on” work—security triage, dependency management, and build/release care—so reliability does not depend on heroics.

### Runway and Partners
Our Phase I award (#2434925, received two weeks ago) funds OSE scoping and participation in I‑Corps for POSE. Arnold Ventures is supporting development of state and congressional district weights in the U.S., building on earlier work in the UK funded by the Nuffield Foundation. Their prior investments also enabled user‑customizable behavioral responses and SALT‑AMT interaction analysis using PolicyEngine’s state encodings—tools used to brief congressional staff—and helped seed open libraries that groups such as the Yale Budget Lab have adopted. The UK Cabinet Office engagement, documented in HM Treasury’s Algorithmic Transparency Record, underscores government appetite for integrating PolicyEngine into policy workflows and provides a concrete model for U.S. public‑sector adoption. Together, these relationships create a practical runway for the OSE to grow while maintaining a disciplined, open process.

### Industry Participation
Commercial adopters help sustain the ecosystem with both engineering and funding. When a tax firm or software vendor needs a new provision or a state‑level nuance, the change is specified, implemented with tests and documentation, and merged upstream so the policy community gains the capability as well. When a market‑research firm or financial institution funds performance or data‑pipeline improvements, we ship them as signed, reproducible releases. We do not grant exclusivity; instead, sponsors receive recognition, predictable delivery, and the benefits of an expanding contributor base. POSE funds remain focused on OSE enablement and operations (governance, security, release engineering, onboarding, evaluation); firm‑specific features are supported by external funds and incorporated when they generalize.
