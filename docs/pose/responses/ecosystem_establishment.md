### Commercial Adoption Channels
PolicyEngine’s OSE is strengthened by commercial users whose day‑to‑day needs closely overlap with public‑interest analysis. Tax accountants and tax‑software vendors can use the rules engine to test scenarios and ensure compliance across federal and state regimes; when they request a new provision or fix, our contribution playbook makes it easy to upstream the change—either by submitting a pull request themselves or by funding us or a maintainer to implement it with tests and documentation so it benefits the wider policy community. Market‑research organizations and retailers can use our calibrated local microdata (with forthcoming consumption integration) to understand county‑level demand, affordability, and incidence under policy changes; their improvements to data adapters, validation, or pipelines are likewise upstreamed and versioned. Financial institutions can apply the same local datasets and rules for economic projections and stress‑testing; where they underwrite performance improvements, we turn them into documented, reproducible releases. In each case, a permissive license, clear governance, and a straightforward CLA/DCO path align commercial incentives with public benefit.

Two concrete integrations illustrate immediate momentum. First, the UK Cabinet Office engagement is already informing government‑grade workflows; we will capture the lessons into governance and adoption playbooks and seek a formal letter of collaboration. Second, we will develop calibrated weights for states and congressional districts and package them as reusable data artifacts with documented pipelines, supported by Arnold Ventures in the U.S. following earlier UK work funded by the Nuffield Foundation. Alongside these, we will publish stable releases of L0, MicroImpute, and MicroCalibrate with quickstarts and examples and invite maintainers to steward each module.

We will track progress using a small set of meaningful indicators: non‑team pull requests and issues per month, active maintainers and time‑to‑review, release frequency and the number of named deployments, and the reproducibility of published analyses. These measures are simple to compute and make adoption and contributor health visible to reviewers and partners.

### Current Users and Collaborators
PolicyEngine already supports real policy workflows. The U.S. Joint Economic Committee has used the platform to examine distributional and budget questions. New York State Senator Andrew Gounardes’s office and D.C. Councilmember Zachary Parker’s office have both used the rules engine to simulate tax‑credit reform proposals, iterating quickly on design details and distributional effects. The Niskanen Center uses PolicyEngine for public‑interest policy analysis and communication. The New York Times also employed the model during its coverage of the 2025 reconciliation bill (the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”), and although that analysis was not published due to the bill passing more quickly than expected, that work hardened our release and validation processes. With support from the Nuffield Foundation, we enlisted Citizen Codex to conduct a UX research study; the findings are informing contributor onboarding, documentation structure, and the layout of example‑driven “first‑run” experiences.

Collaboration with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) continues under a formal memorandum of understanding. Working with Dan Feenberg, we have built an automated validation tool that compares calculations across hundreds of thousands of scenarios against TAXSIM, and we are now building a TAXSIM emulator using PolicyEngine on the backend to provide researchers a familiar interface while enabling full transparency. Feenberg is also advising our I‑Corps for POSE participation as an external mentor, helping translate decades of TAXSIM operational lessons into our OSE practices.

Philanthropic and research partners are reinforcing adoption. Arnold Ventures has supported capabilities including customizable behavioral responses, SALT‑AMT interaction analysis, and state/district breakdowns that enable members of Congress and the public to understand how tax policy affects their own communities. These investments have cascading effects—when PolicyEngine presented our novel imputation method at the National Tax Association meeting, an attendee from the Yale Budget Lab (an Arnold grantee) adopted it, improving their own simulations. PolicyEngine's microimpute library packages this invention to make it even easier for others to leverage and improve the accuracy of their policy modeling. Internationally, the UK Cabinet Office engagement is documented in HM Treasury’s Algorithmic Transparency Record, and major UK policy institutions—including the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Resolution Foundation, and Centre for Policy Studies—have begun using PolicyEngine to validate analyses. In parallel, academic users at USC are applying PolicyEngine to study marginal tax rates and benefit cliffs and are exploring bridges to Census workflows (e.g., Supplemental Poverty Measure, distributional national accounts). These relationships illustrate the network effects the OSE is designed to cultivate across academia, government, and civil society.

Complementary research collaborations include work with John Sabelhaus to enhance the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) with imputed state identifiers for state‑tax analysis and early exploration of Social Security reform scenarios, particularly important given the OASI trust fund's projected 2033 depletion. PolicyEngine's microdata calibration tools extend beyond rules engines to innovate on the data side—as a member of the NASEM panel on an integrated income/consumption/wealth dataset, Sabelhaus recognizes that PolicyEngine has already built such a system in the UK and is capable of delivering the same in the US. These open‑source technologies enable the realization of the NASEM panel's aspirational goals, potentially even for constructing longitudinal datasets that form the backbone of Social Security policy simulations.
