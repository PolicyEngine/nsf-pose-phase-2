## Ecosystem Establishment Strategy

PolicyEngine already demonstrates the distributed development essential for a thriving open-source ecosystem. Our GitHub organization's 146 repositories with over 50,000 commits from 30+ contributors show genuine community engagement. The platform's comprehensive scope—9,034 parameters and variables capturing the full complexity of US and UK tax-benefit systems—requires and attracts diverse expertise. The 1,227 open issues on policyengine-us alone and 620+ forks across our projects indicate active participation beyond our core team. UK developers contributed local authority modeling features now being adapted by U.S. states, while USC researchers added benefit cliff visualizations that other universities are extending. The 3x acceleration in repository creation during 2025—60 new repos compared to 16 in 2023—demonstrates explosive growth as the ecosystem matures. This organic expansion proves the ecosystem's viability; we now formalize and scale these emerging patterns.

We will build three interconnected ecosystems around tax-benefit microsimulation, each addressing specific market needs while contributing to shared infrastructure through distributed development.

### 1. Policy Analysis Ecosystem (Research & Government)

Our policy analysis ecosystem builds on strong foundations with active users ranging from the Joint Economic Committee to NBER researchers, USC's Center for Economic and Social Research, the UK Cabinet Office, and state legislators across multiple states including New York and DC. These early adopters validate both the technical capability and the substantial demand for transparent microsimulation tools.

The expansion of this ecosystem centers on a partnership with NCSL to onboard 20 state legislatures in Year 1. We will provide comprehensive training and dedicated support that enables states to analyze Medicaid expansion, TANF modifications, and tax credit designs—analytical capabilities that currently require expensive consultants most states cannot afford. Building on the success of our UK Cabinet Office integration, we will pursue pilots with CBO, Treasury, and state revenue departments, providing detailed validation reports that compare PolicyEngine outputs to internal models to address accuracy concerns and build trust. We recognize that ideologically diverse organizations need transparent baselines for comparing policy proposals, so beyond current think tank users like the Niskanen Center, we will expand to institutions across the political spectrum.

This ecosystem achieves sustainability through a consortium model where states contribute to a shared funding pool, federal agencies provide grants for specific enhancements they need, and think tanks sponsor features that advance their research agendas.

### 2. Benefits Access Ecosystem  

The benefits access ecosystem demonstrates explosive growth as organizations transition from closed to open source solutions. MyFriendBen, backed by $2.4 million from the Gates Foundation, leads this adoption wave, having already identified $800 million in unclaimed benefits for 50,000 Colorado families using PolicyEngine's API. The broader movement validates our open-source approach as multiple benefit navigation platforms explore migrating from closed-source alternatives to PolicyEngine. These organizations choose transparency, cost-effectiveness, and the ability to contribute improvements over proprietary lock-in.

To accelerate this ecosystem transition, we will create standard API integrations and migration tools that enable rapid platform switching, complemented by white-label solutions for immediate deployment. Healthcare systems represent a particularly promising expansion opportunity. As hospitals and clinics increasingly screen patients for benefits, programs like Mount Sinai's demonstrate how identifying Medicaid eligibility simultaneously reduces uncompensated care and improves patient outcomes. We envision commercial partnerships where tax preparation firms help identify EITC and CTC eligibility among their clients, banks integrate our tools for customer financial health assessments, and employers use them for comprehensive benefits counseling programs.

The sustainability model for this ecosystem combines API licensing fees from commercial users with grants from healthcare systems seeking to reduce uncompensated care, all while maintaining foundation support to ensure free access for community organizations serving vulnerable populations.

### 3. Educational Ecosystem

Academic engagement shows promising momentum across multiple institutions. USC faculty are already using PolicyEngine for HHS-funded research, while our seminars at Berkeley, Georgetown, Northwestern, and University of South Carolina have generated significant interest. Ongoing conversations with Duke and Harvard policy schools explore potential adoption pathways. Through Dan Feenberg's involvement, the NBER network connects us with hundreds of affiliated researchers ready to embrace open-source tools for policy analysis.

Our expansion strategy for the educational ecosystem involves developing comprehensive course modules tailored to different academic levels and disciplines. These modules will include problem sets using real legislation, coding exercises enhanced with AI assistance, and policy briefs that match government formatting standards. To build engagement and prestige, we will launch annual policy modeling competitions judged by former government economists, with winners presenting their work at ASSA meetings. The "PolicyEngine Certified Analyst" program will provide formal credentials for students and professionals who master tax-benefit rules, microsimulation methods, and reproducible analysis practices. Recognizing that Tax-Calculator remains the most common teaching tool in many programs, we will create detailed conversion guides that demonstrate migration paths and highlight the advantages of integrated benefits modeling over tax-only analysis.

Universities will sustain this ecosystem through payments for enterprise features and support services, certification fees from the analyst program, and NSF education grants that support curriculum development and student training initiatives.

### Ecosystem Expansion Opportunities

While Phase II focuses on proven tax-benefit microsimulation markets in the US and UK, we will explore adjacent ecosystems as the platform matures. The tax accounting sector represents a natural extension, as our rules engines have commercial applications for tax preparation firms and accounting software seeking transparent, validated calculations. Similarly, our Enhanced CPS—synthetic households with statistically imputed income, consumption, and wealth from multiple federal sources—calibrated at congressional district and county levels creates value for market research firms and economic development agencies analyzing regional demographics and purchasing power. International expansion also shows promise, with researchers in Canada, Germany, and Australia expressing interest in adapting our approach for their national contexts. These explorations will remain opportunistic rather than core focus, ensuring we deliver on primary objectives while identifying sustainable growth paths that emerge organically from community needs.

### Implementation Timeline (May 2026 - April 2028)

**Year 1 Q1-Q2 (May - Oct 2026)**: Apply I-Corps findings immediately: establish governance structure, launch state consortium pilot with 5 states leveraging summer period
**Year 1 Q3-Q4 (Nov 2026 - Apr 2027)**: Deploy educational modules at 10 universities for spring semester, expand benefits navigator network to 20 organizations
**Year 2 Q1-Q2 (May - Oct 2027)**: Scale to 20 states, 30 universities, standardize commercial API partnerships
**Year 2 Q3-Q4 (Nov 2027 - Apr 2028)**: Achieve sustainability metrics: 50% budget from user contributions, 100+ certified analysts

### Success Metrics

By the end of Year 2, we will achieve adoption across 20 state governments, 30 universities, and 50 benefits organizations actively using the platform. Impact metrics include $2 billion in benefits accessed through partner organizations, 10,000 students trained in microsimulation methods, and 100 policy analyses published using PolicyEngine. Financial sustainability will be demonstrated through $750K in annual revenue from consortium fees, training programs, and API licensing. The community will include 50 active contributors and 5 institutional maintainers providing 24-hour global support coverage.
