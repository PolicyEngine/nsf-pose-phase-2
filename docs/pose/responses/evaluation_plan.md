- **Geographic Expansion**: Active users in [PLACEHOLDER: verify country target] countries, with dedicated support in [PLACEHOLDER: verify language target] languages

**2. Community Contribution Health** (development velocity and sustainability):
- **External Contributors**: [PLACEHOLDER: verify current contributors] regular → [PLACEHOLDER: verify target contributors] active contributors
- **Pull Request Metrics**: Median review time [PLACEHOLDER: verify current review time] → [PLACEHOLDER: verify target review time], [PLACEHOLDER: verify merge rate target] merge rate maintained
- **Issue Resolution**: Median resolution time [PLACEHOLDER: verify current resolution time] → [PLACEHOLDER: verify target resolution time] for standard issues

- **Documentation Quality**: User satisfaction [PLACEHOLDER: verify satisfaction target], tutorial completion rate [PLACEHOLDER: verify completion target]

**3. Technical Quality and Security Assurance**:
- **Code Coverage**: Maintain [PLACEHOLDER: verify line coverage target] line coverage, [PLACEHOLDER: verify branch coverage target] branch coverage across all packages
- **Security Response**: Critical vulnerabilities patched within [PLACEHOLDER: verify critical patch time], high-severity within [PLACEHOLDER: verify high-severity patch time]
- **Release Quality**: [PLACEHOLDER: verify release percentage] of releases include SBOM, GPG signatures, and automated security scans
- **Cross-Model Validation**: [PLACEHOLDER: verify agreement target] agreement with TAXSIM, CBO, and peer models on core scenarios
- **Reproducibility Audits**: [PLACEHOLDER: verify analysis percentage] of published analyses include runnable code and documented data lineage

**4. Data Calibration Performance** (statistical accuracy and methodological rigor):
- **State-Level Accuracy**: Demographic targets within [PLACEHOLDER: verify demographic accuracy] of Census ACS, economic targets within [PLACEHOLDER: verify economic accuracy] of IRS SOI
- **Congressional District Precision**: Population weights matching official Census totals within [PLACEHOLDER: verify precision margin] margin
- **Loss Function Convergence**: L2 loss [PLACEHOLDER: verify L2 target] for demographic targets, L1 loss [PLACEHOLDER: verify L1 target] for economic targets
- **Holdout Validation**: Cross-validation performance stable within [PLACEHOLDER: verify stability percentage] across different train/test splits
- **Administrative Target Coverage**: [PLACEHOLDER: verify coverage percentage] of available targets incorporated, with documented exclusion rationale

### Systematic Measurement and Continuous Improvement Process

**Data Collection and Monitoring Infrastructure**:
- **Public Dashboard**: Real-time metrics updated daily at metrics.policyengine.org with historical trends
- **Automated Data Pipeline**: GitHub Actions integration collecting contribution metrics, usage analytics, and performance data
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: Aggregated usage patterns without individual user tracking, GDPR-compliant data retention
- **Quarterly Stakeholder Surveys**: Structured feedback collection from 4 user segments (government, academic, media, advocacy)

**Evaluation Methodology and Statistical Analysis**:
- **Baseline Establishment**: Comprehensive metrics collection in Month 1 with historical trend analysis where available
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Controlled experiments for major UI changes, onboarding improvements, and community interventions
- **Longitudinal Analysis**: Monthly cohort analysis tracking user progression from first visit to active contributor
- **Comparative Benchmarking**: Quarterly comparison with peer OSS projects (similar scale, domain, community structure)

**Steering Committee Review Process** (evidence-based decision making):
- **Monthly Metrics Review**: Core team assessment of trend directions with alert thresholds for concerning patterns
- **Quarterly Strategic Assessment**: Steering committee evaluation of progress against annual targets with roadmap adjustments
- **I-Corps Integration**: Customer interview insights systematically incorporated into metric interpretation and priority setting
- **Annual External Review**: Independent evaluation by OSS ecosystem experts with published assessment report

**Transparency and Accountability Framework**:
- **Public Reporting**: Quarterly progress reports published on project blog with methodology transparency
- **NSF Reporting Integration**: Automated generation of required federal reports with detailed progress narratives
- **Community Feedback Loops**: Monthly community calls presenting metrics and soliciting input on interpretation and priorities
- **Academic Publication**: Annual methodology paper in peer-reviewed venue documenting evaluation approach and lessons learned

**Continuous Improvement Process** (adaptive management approach):
- **Early Warning System**: Automated alerts for metrics falling below threshold values with escalation procedures
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Systematic investigation of negative trends with documented remediation plans
- **Success Pattern Recognition**: Analysis of positive outliers to identify scalable best practices
- **Course Correction Protocol**: Formal process for major strategic pivots based on evaluation evidence with community consultation
