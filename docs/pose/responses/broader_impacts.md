# Broader Impacts

PolicyEngine's open-source ecosystem will transform how society analyzes and implements tax-benefit policy, addressing critical gaps in democratic policymaking infrastructure while advancing scientific understanding of policy effects on diverse populations.

## Democratizing Policy Analysis

The current concentration of microsimulation capability in twelve institutions creates profound inequities in policy development. State legislatures allocating billions in TANF and Medicaid funds rely on static Excel models that cannot capture program interactions. Community colleges teaching public finance use outdated textbook examples rather than real policy tools. Local governments implementing housing assistance programs cannot model eligibility cliffs that trap families in poverty.

PolicyEngine eliminates these barriers. Our platform has already enabled the Joint Economic Committee to independently analyze federal proposals, helped New York State Senator Gounardes model tax credit designs, and empowered USC researchers to conduct marginal tax rate studies previously impossible without proprietary access. By Phase II completion, we project 20 state governments, 30 universities, and 50 community organizations will actively use PolicyEngine, fundamentally reshaping who participates in evidence-based policymaking.

## Accelerating Benefits Access

The $80 billion annual gap in unclaimed benefits represents both massive individual hardship and systemic policy failure. Our partnership with MyFriendBen demonstrates the transformative potential of open-source microsimulation for benefits access. Using PolicyEngine's API, MyFriendBen identified $800 million in unclaimed benefits for 50,000 Colorado families. The platform is expanding nationwide with $2.4 million in Gates Foundation support.

This impact multiplies through ecosystem effects as multiple organizations explore migrating from closed-source alternatives to PolicyEngine's open infrastructure. Each organization brings domain expertise while contributing improvements that benefit the entire ecosystem. We project $2 billion in additional benefits accessed by Year 2 through partner organizations.

## Transforming Policy Education

Current policy education suffers from a theory-practice gap: students learn simplified models disconnected from real-world complexity. PolicyEngine enables authentic policy learning using the same tools that analyze actual legislation. Our curriculum modules for USC's public finance course, Georgetown's Better Government Lab projects, and Berkeley's policy seminars provide students hands-on experience with production-grade microsimulation.

The educational impact extends beyond traditional programs. Through partnerships with community colleges and Minority-Serving Institutions, we will train a diverse generation of policy analysts previously excluded from this field. Our "PolicyEngine Certified Analyst" program provides formal credentials recognized by government agencies and research institutions, creating career pathways into policy analysis for underrepresented communities.

## Building State and Local Capacity

State and local governments implement most safety net programs yet lack analytical tools to design effective policies. NCSL confirms that most states cannot model basic questions like "How would expanding EITC affect working families?" or "What are the interaction effects between SNAP and childcare subsidies?" This analytical deficit perpetuates inefficient policies that fail to achieve intended outcomes.

PolicyEngine addresses this through targeted capacity building. Our state consortium model provides training, dedicated support, and collaborative development ensuring states can analyze their unique policy landscapes. The UK Cabinet Office's successful integration—with Nikhil Woodruff currently on secondment to support their implementation—provides a template for U.S. federal agency adoption. By enabling evidence-based policy design at all government levels, PolicyEngine strengthens democratic governance and improves outcomes for millions of families.

## Advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

The concentration of microsimulation capability in elite institutions perpetuates systemic inequities in policy analysis. PolicyEngine's open-source approach directly addresses these disparities through interconnected pathways that expand access and participation.

Our partnerships with community colleges, HBCUs, and Hispanic-Serving Institutions ensure that diverse institutions can teach and conduct research using professional-grade tools previously available only to well-resourced universities. The modular architecture of our platform enables community-driven translations and cultural adaptations, making policy analysis accessible to non-English speaking communities who have been historically excluded from these conversations.

Perhaps most importantly, open-source code exposes model assumptions for scrutiny, enabling communities to identify and correct biases that may disadvantage marginalized populations. Unlike proprietary models where affected communities have no voice in how their circumstances are modeled, PolicyEngine enables direct contribution of improvements based on lived experience of policy impacts. This participatory development model transforms beneficiaries from passive subjects of analysis to active contributors shaping how policies affecting their lives are evaluated.

## Mitigating Potential Negative Impacts

We acknowledge that democratizing policy analysis tools could enable misleading advocacy or politically motivated distortions. PolicyEngine addresses these risks through comprehensive safeguards built into both our technology and governance structures.

Every calculation includes detailed breakdowns that enable fact-checkers to verify claims, with continuous validation against TAXSIM and other established models providing accuracy benchmarks that users can reference. Model limitations and parameter sources are explicitly documented throughout the platform, preventing misrepresentation of preliminary analyses as definitive conclusions. Our training materials emphasize responsible analysis practices, uncertainty communication, and ethical considerations in policy modeling, ensuring that users understand both the power and limitations of microsimulation.

The steering committee, composed of diverse stakeholders from government, academia, and community organizations, reviews controversial use cases and establishes ethical guidelines for platform use. This governance structure ensures that democratization doesn't come at the expense of analytical integrity.

## Catalyzing Open-Source Innovation

PolicyEngine demonstrates the viability of open-source approaches for critical policy infrastructure. Our success catalyzes broader adoption of open-source models in government technology, showing that transparent, community-driven development can match or exceed proprietary alternatives in quality while dramatically expanding access.

The ecosystem's modular architecture—with independently maintained packages for L0 regularization, quantile regression forests, and microdata calibration—provides a template for sustainable open-source development. Each component attracts specialized contributors while benefiting from integration with the broader platform. This model influences how other policy technology projects approach open-source sustainability.

## Measuring Broader Impact

We will track broader impacts through concrete metrics:
- Number of states using PolicyEngine for legislative analysis (target: 20 by Year 2)
- Students trained in microsimulation methods (target: 10,000 by Year 2)
- Benefits accessed through partner organizations (target: $2 billion by Year 2)
- Research papers using PolicyEngine (target: 100 annually by Year 2)
- Contributors from underrepresented groups (target: 40% by Year 2)
- Policy analyses conducted by previously excluded organizations (target: 1,000 by Year 2)

These metrics demonstrate not just usage but transformative impact on who participates in policy analysis and how evidence informs democratic decision-making.
