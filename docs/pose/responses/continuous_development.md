### Methodology and Infrastructure
We will practice trunk‑based development with protected branches and continuous integration that runs unit and integration tests, produces deterministic builds, and stores build artifacts for traceability. Reproducible analysis pipelines use pinned environments and explicit provenance so a reviewer or partner can rerun a result and get the same numbers.

### Quality, Security, and Privacy
Quality gates combine coverage targets, static analysis, and dependency scanning. Every release is signed and accompanied by a software bill of materials and checksums for verification. Sensitive changes receive two‑person review and critical paths have named codeowners. No sensitive data is stored in the repository; adapters are designed to run locally or in secure environments, and we document anonymization and pseudonymization patterns for teams that need them.

### Release and Backports
We will ship on a predictable cadence and maintain long‑term‑support branches for adopters who need stability. Security fixes are backported promptly and communicated with clear advisories so downstream systems can patch confidently.

### Modular Packages and Documentation
The modular packages make these practices concrete. L0 delivers layers and penalties with examples and property tests that replace one‑off sparsity code in downstream repositories. MicroImpute provides QRF‑based imputation with benchmarking and a typed API. MicroCalibrate exposes reweighting with loss categories and administrative target loading and integrates L0 sparsity with tuning and holdout robustness. All three come with narrative documentation and examples that shorten the path from first import to first contribution.

### Validation and Interoperability
To help teams migrate with confidence, we will publish a transparent validation harness that compares PolicyEngine to TAXSIM (Feenberg & Coutts 1993) and to peer tools such as PSL Tax‑Calculator, the Atlanta Fed Policy Rules Database scenarios, Yale Budget Lab tools, and BenefitKitchen, as well as to published scores from ITEP, the Tax Foundation, CBO, and JCT. The harness runs in CI with versioned scenario packs and emits signed scorecards and dashboards that track deltas by provision and geography over time. Internationally, we will add scenarios for the UK (IPPR, HMT, OBR) and Canada (SPSDM) to help researchers and agencies cross‑walk results. An independent evaluator will audit assumptions and methods and publish an assessment. These activities build trust and reduce the switching cost for teams migrating from closed or bespoke models, without using Phase II funds for net‑new feature development.
