- **Continuous Integration Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with 15-minute build times, parallel testing across Python 3.9-3.13 and Node.js 18-20
- **Build Reproducibility**: Docker containers with pinned dependencies, deterministic builds using pip-tools and package-lock.json
- **Artifact Management**: Binary releases stored in GitHub Releases with GPG signatures, container images in GitHub Container Registry

**Testing Infrastructure** (comprehensive automated validation):
- **Unit Tests**: [PLACEHOLDER: verify test case count] test cases with [PLACEHOLDER: verify line coverage] line coverage, property-based testing for mathematical functions using Hypothesis
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end API workflows, cross-model validation against TAXSIM/CBO, and full-stack web application testing
- **Performance Testing**: Automated benchmarks tracking API response times (<50ms target), memory usage profiling, and scalability testing
- **Regression Testing**: Historical scenario comparison across releases, alerting on [PLACEHOLDER: verify difference threshold] calculation differences

**Reproducible Analysis Pipelines**:
