# Mentoring Plan

**Project**: PolicyEngine: Building an Open Ecosystem for Tax-Benefit Microsimulation

While this POSE Phase II project primarily employs professional staff, we recognize that early-career researchers may join the team as data scientists or contribute through partner institutions. This mentoring plan ensures all early-career team members receive comprehensive professional development.

## Mentoring Activities

**Technical Skills Development**: Early-career researchers will receive hands-on training in production software engineering practices including version control, code review, continuous integration, and documentation. They will participate in all technical working groups, gaining exposure to microsimulation methods, data calibration techniques, and validation frameworks. Each will have a designated senior mentor for weekly one-on-one technical guidance.

**Professional Development**: Team members will present at major conferences (NTA, ASSA, APPAM) with travel support and coaching on effective presentation. They will co-author technical reports and peer-reviewed publications with senior staff providing writing guidance and revision support. We will facilitate connections with our network of collaborators at NBER, USC, Georgetown, and government agencies for career advancement opportunities.

**Open-Source Leadership Training**: As this project builds an open-source ecosystem, early-career members will learn community management, contributor onboarding, and governance practices. They will lead specific initiatives (documentation sprints, validation campaigns) to build project management skills. Through rotations across technical working groups, they will understand the full stack of policy modeling infrastructure.

**Career Planning**: Quarterly career development meetings will assess progress toward individual goals, whether academic, government, or industry focused. We will provide recommendation letters highlighting specific contributions to the PolicyEngine ecosystem. Team members will build public portfolios through credited contributions to open-source repositories and published validation studies.

## Success Metrics

Mentoring effectiveness will be evaluated through: (1) successful conference presentations and publications; (2) advancement to leadership roles within technical working groups; (3) placement in permanent positions leveraging PolicyEngine expertise; (4) sustained contributions to the ecosystem beyond project involvement.

This mentoring approach ensures early-career researchers develop both technical expertise in microsimulation and professional skills for leadership in open-source policy analysis communities.
