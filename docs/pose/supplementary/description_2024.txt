Context of OSE
PolicyEngine is an open-source economic modeling platform that democratizes access to sophisticated policy analysis tools, addressing pressing issues of national and societal importance. Our platform has been recognized by the UN-endorsed Digital Public Goods Alliance (Woodruff 2023) and powers analysis at major institutions like the Niskanen Center (Ghenis & Gross 2024). Our suite of software empowers researchers, policymakers, and the public to analyze complex tax and benefit systems across federal, state, and local levels in the United States, grounding public policy debates in credible data and evidence.
Historically, policy modeling tools have been siloed within government agencies and think tanks, limiting broader participation in policy analysis and debate. PolicyEngine addresses this gap through three core components: a comprehensive tax-benefit rules engine, integrated microdata, and accessible interfaces:
	•	Our open-source tax-benefit rules engine precisely models intricate policy rules, enabling researchers to accurately calculate historical tax liabilities, benefit eligibility, and marginal tax rates, enriching understanding of national economic trends and policy impacts. 
	•	We apply advanced data science techniques to construct accurate, representative datasets of the US population (Ghenis & Woodruff 2024), reducing deviations from administrative statistics by over 90% (Woodruff 2022a). This forms the foundation for policy simulations and impact analyses that inform decisions on issues of societal importance, such as income inequality, poverty reduction, and economic mobility. 
	•	To make complex policy analysis accessible to a broader audience, we offer multiple ways to interact with our model, including a web application, API, and Python package, recently enhanced with AI-powered explanations (Volk 2024), fostering more inclusive and informed public discourse on critical national issues.
The power of open-source collaboration is crucial to realizing PolicyEngine's full potential. Our active open-source community already includes 50 current developers and over 100 total contributors who enhance our codebase through GitHub. These contributors make substantial technical additions - economists parameterize new tax policies, software developers improve our web interface and API functionality, and data scientists enhance our microsimulation methods. By making our entire codebase and methodology publicly visible, we invite scrutiny and build trust.
An active community of contributors is essential to PolicyEngine's continued growth and improvement. Our open-source ecosystem enables developers to identify and implement enhancements through our well-documented API (Woodruff 2022b) and microsimulation framework (Woodruff 2022c). Recent grants from NEO Philanthropy (Ghenis 2024a) and the Nuffield Foundation (Ghenis 2024b) support our transition to a sustainable organization.
Through this POSE Phase I project, we aim to develop a comprehensive plan for establishing PolicyEngine as a robust OSE, evolving from a project of the Policy Simulation Library Foundation into an independent 501(c)(3) managing organization. This transition will ensure long-term sustainability and maximize our impact on evidence-based policymaking in the United States.
Risk Analysis/Security Plan
PolicyEngine's OSE faces several key risks we will actively mitigate through: automated testing and code review processes for all external contributions; a secure continuous integration pipeline with branch protection, signed commits, and automated vulnerability scanning following CISA guidelines; robust data privacy controls for sensitive policy data; clear governance processes for maintaining nonpartisan standards; recognition systems for contributor retention; and diversified funding sources for long-term sustainability.
I-Corps Training
Our team will participate in I-Corps for POSE training to refine our approach. The team includes the PI, our community engagement manager, and an experienced external mentor. Through 100+ stakeholder interviews and workshop participation, we will validate our distributed development model and identify key opportunities for community growth.
Per the POSE Phase I requirement for I-Corps–style training, we have identified Dr. Dan Feenberg as our external mentor. Dr. Feenberg is the creator and longtime steward of TAXSIM, introduced in Feenberg & Coutts (1993) and cited in over 1,100 academic publications. TAXSIM has historically been closed-source, but Dr. Feenberg is now actively collaborating with PolicyEngine to build an open-source emulator that replicates TAXSIM’s input/output interface using PolicyEngine’s rules engine. This approach will enable the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) to migrate the backend of TAXSIM to an open-source environment while maintaining continuity for its large user base. Dr. Feenberg is advising on that technical transition and helping ensure accurate cross-validation of state and federal tax rules.
Dr. Feenberg’s role as mentor will include 41 hours of participation in the I-Corps training sessions, offering additional consultation and feedback as needed within that timeframe. His deep experience in economics, software engineering, and academic research makes him exceptionally well-suited to guide our ecosystem discovery—particularly around rigorous validation, data integrity, and bridging academic and open-source communities. He will serve as an independent resource to ensure our strategic decisions and deliverables align with best practices for both policy modeling and open-source community-building.
Intellectual Merit
PolicyEngine advances economic policy analysis by combining precision rule-based software with advanced microsimulation strategies. Our approach yields a uniquely comprehensive and transparent policy analysis tool:
	•	Comprehensive Modeling: Our model calculates net income and marginal tax rates across complex tax and benefit systems, projecting impacts of policy reforms on poverty, inequality, and budgets. It identifies disparities by demographic factors and flags unintended consequences, providing crucial insights for policymakers and researchers.
	•	Advanced Computational Methods: We employ quantile regression forests and gradient descent, enabling more accurate simulation of a broader range of policy reforms and capturing intricate interactions between tax and benefit programs. Our recent implementation of behavioral responses (Ghenis et al. 2024; Ahmadi 2024) allows modeling of how policies affect labor supply and other economic behaviors.
	•	Accessible User Interface: Our mobile-friendly web interface empowers users without coding or economics expertise to model reforms. It includes an AI-powered feature (currently using the Claude API, with exploration of open-source LLMs underway) that generates plain-language explanations of policy impacts.
	•	Modular Architecture: Our software platform features specialized country packages, a versatile API, and tools for microdata handling. This design facilitates contributions from the open-source community while maintaining national-level modeling accuracy.
As shown in Table 1, PolicyEngine uniquely combines open-source accessibility, comprehensive coverage of taxes and benefits, integrated microdata, reform impact analysis, and both public and API access. This positions PolicyEngine at the forefront of policy analysis tools, offering previously unavailable capabilities in a single, integrated platform. By bridging academic rigor and practical accessibility, PolicyEngine is poised to transform economic policy analysis, enabling more informed, data-driven decision-making across government and society.
