Dear Review Committee:

As Director of Welfare at the Nuffield Foundation, a leading and highly respected independent UK research funder, I am delighted to write this letter setting out my positive experience of working with Policy Engine and providing my support for giving close consideration to PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal to establish an Open-Source Ecosystem for transparent economic policy analysis.

The Nuffield Foundation's substantial investment in PolicyEngine UK was based on a strong belief in the organisation's mission and its potential to achieve real impact on UK policymaking and we are delighted by the performance of the team in this regard.

The Nuffield Foundation awarded PolicyEngine a Â£251,296 grant (September 2024-2025) to enhance, localise and democratise tax-benefit policy analysis through PolicyEngine UK. This investment is supporting PolicyEngine in significantly expanding the capabilities of its UK tax-benefit modelling by including public services and childcare subsidies, and creating small area estimates at constituency and local authority level. Due to PolicyEngine's open source commitment, citizens, researchers, and civil society organisations have free access to analytical capabilities previously restricted to government departments and well-resourced think tanks.

The award of this grant was on the basis of the alignment of its plans to democratise access to sophisticated policy analysis with the Nuffield Foundation's mission to improve social wellbeing and reduce inequality through funding world-class innovative research. We were, and continue to be, impressed by the team's dynamism and their commitment to scaling up both the comprehensiveness of their microsimulation alongside its accessibility.

We see PolicyEngine's secondment to the Cabinet Office, following HM Treasury's investigation, as a sign that the team is operating at the frontier of tax-benefit modelling. It is our understanding that some government economists are exploring how PolicyEngine can complement proprietary models, while major UK policy institutions including NIESR, NEF, and Centre for Policy Studies have begun using PolicyEngine to conduct and validate their analyses.

The US-UK PolicyEngine collaboration has provided some positive spillovers in both directions. We understand that the UK innovations in benefit interactions have benefitted US researchers, while US advances in state-level modelling have informed the team's development of small area estimates in the UK. We see the potential for further mutually beneficial knowledge exchanges.

Based on the Nuffield Foundation's experience funding PolicyEngine UK and observing its impact, I strongly endorse Policy Engine as an innovative, dynamic and outcome-focused organisation to work with. Therefore, I reiterate my view that this Phase II proposal merits close consideration by NSF. NSF support would have the potential to help to catalyse a global transformation in how societies analyse, debate, and implement public policy.

Sincerely,

Mark Franks
