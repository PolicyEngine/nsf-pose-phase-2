Dear Review Committee:

As Executive Vice President of Public Finance at Arnold Ventures ("AV"), I strongly support PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. Our investments and my direct congressional experience demonstrate its transformative potential.

Arnold Ventures funded three key capabilities: (1) user-customizable behavioral responses exposing previously black-boxed assumptions like labor supply elasticities; (2) SALT-AMT interaction analysis leveraging PolicyEngine's unique state tax encodings, used to educate Congress on TCJA and OBBBA impacts; (3) state/district breakdowns enabling members of Congress and the public to understand how tax policy affects their own communities.

These investments have cascading effects through developing technologies that benefit other AV grantees and the broader economics and data science worlds. For example, when PolicyEngine presented their novel imputation method at the National Tax Association meeting, an attendee from the Yale Budget Lab (an AV grantee) adopted it, improving their own simulations. PolicyEngine's microimpute library packages this invention to make it even easier for others to leverage and improve the accuracy of their policy modeling.

My 15 years on Capitol Hill, including serving as chief tax counsel at the House Ways and Means Committee and as senior tax counsel to Speaker Paul Ryan, taught me that information asymmetries undermine policymaking. PolicyEngine democratizes analysis by providing sophisticated capabilities to allâ€“as especially demonstrated by our use of their SALT-AMT tool to educate members of Congress and their staffs during 2025 reconciliation negotiations that modified these complex policies. The OSE aligns with AV's commitment to evidence-based solutions, transparency, and rigorous analysis.

Arnold Ventures can support the OSE through strategic engagement and our network of policymakers, researchers, and funders. I strongly urge NSF support for this essential democratic infrastructure.

Sincerely,

George Callas
