# Letter of Support - Mark Franks, Nuffield Foundation

**[SUBMITTED VERSION - DECLINED]**

Mark Franks responded on September 2, 2025:

"This is very short notice! I wish you luck with the application but as funders ourselves we can't directly endorse applications we know little about. However, I can make positive comments about Policy Engine's work with us and say that I think any application should be carefully considered."

Status: Will provide limited support letter about Nuffield's experience with PolicyEngine but cannot formally endorse the NSF application.
