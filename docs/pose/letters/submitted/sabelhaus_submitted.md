Dear Review Committee:

I am writing to express my strongest support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. As former Assistant Director at the Federal Reserve Board overseeing the Survey of Consumer Finances and former Chief of Long-Term Modeling at the Congressional Budget Office, I have unique insight into PolicyEngine's transformative potential.

Having overseen the SCF at the Federal Reserve and directed CBOLT model development at CBO, I understand the constraints of closed-source models. With TAXSIM, researchers cannot examine edge cases, verify assumptions, or contribute improvements—fundamentally limiting research progress. The contrast with PolicyEngine's open approach could not be starker.

I am exploring PolicyEngine's microdata calibration to enhance the SCF by imputing state identifiers (excluded for confidentiality), enabling state tax calculations while maintaining privacy. I'm also exploring PolicyEngine for Social Security reform analysis, beginning with development of the public use longitudinal input file that would be the foundation for a new OS integrated micro, macro, and budget model. I am also coordinating with PolicyEngine and economists at Brookings and government agencies to document advantages of the OS tax calculator relative to TAXSIM.

Having built models within government, I understand that transparency is essential for democratic legitimacy. PolicyEngine addresses the reproducibility crisis stemming from proprietary models and enables rapid policy response without depending on single maintainers. For Social Security reform affecting every American, PolicyEngine's transparency allows stakeholders to verify impacts—essential for democratic governance.

I strongly urge NSF support. PolicyEngine represents the future of economic policy analysis and is uniquely positioned to lead this transformation.

Please feel free to contact me if you require any additional information about PolicyEngine's capabilities or my collaboration with their team.

Sincerely,
