Dear Review Committee:

I am writing to express NBER's strong support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem will provide important infrastructure for economic research.

The NBER-PolicyEngine collaboration has deepened significantly since Phase I. Daniel Feenberg, former NBER IT Director and creator of TAXSIM, who has decades of experience building the TAXSIM ecosystem, is collaborating with PolicyEngine on these projects. Feenberg also serves as the external mentor for their I-Corps training.

Under the terms of our current MOU, PolicyEngine has built initial versions of two key tools for tax policy research:

1. A TAXSIM emulator using PolicyEngine on the backend, which will provide researchers with a familiar interface while enabling full transparency, and

2. An automated validation tool that compares tax calculations for tens of thousands of tax filers with calculations from TAXSIM. This tool demonstrates both technical rigor and commitment to accuracy.

Phase II support will enable expansion of the validation infrastructure to compare PolicyEngine results against additional models, further building public trust in open-source solutions.

While TAXSIM has served researchers well for decades, PolicyEngine's open-source approach allows them to examine every calculation, trace legislative bases, and contribute improvements â€” essential capabilities as policy analysis demands greater reproducibility. NBER affiliates are beginning to explore PolicyEngine, particularly for research beyond traditional tax calculations. The platform's integration of transfer programs with taxes enables comprehensive distributional analyses, which currently requires complementing TAXSIM with additional models. State-specific policy modeling also opens new avenues for studying federalism.

NBER will continue providing access to Dan Feenberg's expertise and historical knowledge for validation purposes. Some NBER affiliates may contribute to model validation, particularly for dynamic scoring and behavioral response modules.

PolicyEngine addresses an important gap in the existing research infrastructure by combining TAXSIM's reliability with modern software practices and comprehensive scope. NBER's experience confirms that open-source policy modeling can meet the highest standards of academic rigor while expanding access to analytical capabilities. I urge the NSF to support this Phase II proposal.

Sincerely,
