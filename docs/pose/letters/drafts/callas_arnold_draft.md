Dear Review Committee:

As Executive Vice President for Public Finance at Arnold Ventures, I strongly support PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. Our investments and my direct congressional experience demonstrate its transformative potential.

Arnold Ventures funded three key capabilities: (1) user-customizable behavioral responses exposing previously black-boxed assumptions like labor supply elasticities; (2) SALT-AMT interaction analysis leveraging PolicyEngine's unique state tax encodings, used to educate Congress on TCJA and OBBBA impacts; (3) state/district breakdowns enabling members of Congress and the public to understand how tax policy affects their own communities. These investments have cascading effects through developing technologies that benefit other Arnold grantees and the broader economics and data science worlds. For example, when PolicyEngine presented their novel imputation method at the National Tax Association meeting, an attendee from the Yale Budget Lab (an Arnold grantee) adopted it, improving their own simulations. PolicyEngine's microimpute library packages this invention to make it even easier for others to leverage and improve the accuracy of their policy modeling.

During 2025 reconciliation and OBBBA discussions, our SALT-AMT tool demonstrated previously opaque interactions. Real-time policy iterations during meetings enable collaborative development rather than static presentations. When skeptics question our analysis, they can examine the code themselvesâ€”transforming adversarial discussions into collaborative exploration.

My 15 years on Capitol Hill, including serving as senior tax counsel at House Ways and Means and to Speaker Paul Ryan, taught me that information asymmetries undermine policymaking. PolicyEngine democratizes analysis by providing sophisticated capabilities to all, improving outcomes by enabling more voices to contribute evidence-based insights. The OSE aligns with Arnold Ventures' commitment to evidence-based solutions, transparency, and rigorous analysis.

Arnold Ventures can support the OSE through strategic engagement and our network of policymakers, researchers, and funders. I strongly urge NSF support for this essential democratic infrastructure.

Sincerely,

George Callas
