Dear Review Committee:

As Executive Vice President for Public Finance at Arnold Ventures, I am pleased to provide this letter of strong support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal to establish an Open-Source Ecosystem for economic policy analysis. Based on both our substantial philanthropic investment in PolicyEngine and my direct experience using the platform for congressional policy work, I can attest to its transformative potential for evidence-based policymaking.

## Arnold Ventures' Investment and Partnership

Arnold Ventures has made significant investments in PolicyEngine through three major grants supporting local area modeling capabilities, enhancement of the Current Population Survey microdata, and comprehensive model validation. These investments reflect our conviction that transparent, accessible policy analysis tools are essential prerequisites for evidence-based policymaking and informed democratic debate.

Our support extends beyond financial investment. My team actively uses PolicyEngine in our engagement with Congress on tax reform, particularly as we approach the critical 2025 reconciliation process. The expiration of major provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act creates a generational opportunity for tax reform, and PolicyEngine has proven invaluable for analyzing the complex interactions and trade-offs inherent in comprehensive tax legislation.

## Active Use in Congressional Engagement

During recent preparations for the 2025 reconciliation process, PolicyEngine has transformed how we engage with members of Congress and their staff on tax policy. The platform enabled us to disentangle the complex interactions between the Alternative Minimum Tax and State and Local Tax deductions—two of the most watched and politically sensitive provisions in the tax code. When congressional staff questioned specific calculations during meetings, we could show them exactly how the model works, building trust in the analysis through transparency.

The ability to perform real-time policy iterations during congressional meetings has fundamentally changed the nature of these discussions. Rather than presenting static analyses prepared in advance, we can test scenarios suggested by members and staff immediately, enabling genuinely collaborative policy development. This capability to show state-by-state and demographic distributional impacts in real-time helps build the coalitions necessary for successful legislation.

Most importantly, PolicyEngine's open-source nature addresses the skepticism that often greets policy analysis from advocacy organizations. When we present findings, skeptics can examine the underlying code themselves, verify our assumptions, and even run alternative scenarios. This transparency transforms potentially adversarial discussions into collaborative explorations of policy options.

## Commitment to the Open-Source Ecosystem

Arnold Ventures is committed to supporting PolicyEngine's transition to a sustainable Open-Source Ecosystem. We will consider additional grants to support OSE infrastructure development and expansion, recognizing that sustainable public goods require patient capital during their establishment phase. Our extensive network of relationships with policymakers, researchers, and other philanthropic organizations positions us to connect PolicyEngine with users who need transparent analysis tools and funders who share our commitment to evidence-based policy.

Beyond financial support, we will contribute strategic guidance based on our experience building sustainable social sector organizations. I am willing to participate in governance structures that ensure the OSE serves the needs of policy practitioners while maintaining the technical excellence required for credible analysis. We will document and share our use cases, demonstrating how PolicyEngine enables more effective policy advocacy grounded in transparent analysis.

## Strategic Importance for Democratic Governance

My experience in senior positions at the House Ways and Means Committee, Senate Finance Committee, and National Economic Council has taught me that information asymmetries undermine good policymaking. When only a handful of organizations possess the tools to analyze policy proposals comprehensively, democratic deliberation suffers. PolicyEngine's open approach democratizes policy analysis, enabling think tanks to verify government estimates, state officials to understand federal proposal impacts, and citizens to engage meaningfully in policy debates.

The traditional model, where policy analysis depends on proprietary models accessible only to well-resourced institutions, creates an uneven playing field that favors established interests. PolicyEngine levels this field by providing sophisticated analytical capabilities to anyone with internet access. This democratization is not merely about fairness—it improves policy outcomes by enabling more voices to contribute evidence-based insights to policy debates.

## Sustainability Through Community

Arnold Ventures' philanthropic philosophy emphasizes building sustainable solutions that outlast our funding. PolicyEngine's OSE model aligns perfectly with this approach. Community contributions ensure continuous improvement without dependence on any single funder. Open-source architecture prevents vendor lock-in and enables institutional adoption without procurement barriers. Distributed development reduces costs while improving quality through diverse perspectives. Transparent governance builds the trust necessary for broad adoption across the ideological spectrum.

The proposed OSE represents a fundamental shift from grant-dependent projects to community-sustained infrastructure. This transition is essential for PolicyEngine to achieve its potential as a permanent resource for democratic policymaking.

## Recommendation

I strongly urge NSF to support PolicyEngine's Phase II proposal. As someone who has worked at the highest levels of fiscal policymaking in both Congress and the Executive Branch, I understand the critical need for transparent, accurate, and accessible policy analysis tools. PolicyEngine provides these capabilities today, and the proposed OSE will ensure they remain available and continuously improve to meet evolving policy challenges.

The combination of technical excellence, practical policy application, and commitment to transparency makes PolicyEngine uniquely deserving of NSF support. This investment will catalyze a transformation in how our democracy analyzes, debates, and decides critical policy questions.

Sincerely,
