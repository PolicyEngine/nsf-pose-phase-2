Dear Review Committee:

As Executive Vice President for Public Finance at Arnold Ventures, I strongly support PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. Our investments and my direct congressional experience demonstrate its transformative potential.

## Strategic Investments

Arnold Ventures funded three key capabilities: (1) user-customizable behavioral responses exposing previously black-boxed assumptions like labor supply elasticities; (2) SALT-AMT interaction analysis leveraging PolicyEngine's unique state tax encodings, used to educate Congress on TCJA and OBBBA impacts; (3) state/district breakdowns using ML methods, developed as open libraries that other grantees like Yale Budget Lab have adopted.

## Congressional Impact

During 2025 reconciliation and OBBBA discussions, our SALT-AMT tool demonstrated previously opaque interactions. Real-time policy iterations during meetings enable collaborative development rather than static presentations. When skeptics question our analysis, they can examine the code themselvesâ€”transforming adversarial discussions into collaborative exploration.

## OSE Support

Arnold Ventures can support the OSE through strategic engagement and our network of policymakers, researchers, and funders.

## Recommendation

My experience at House Ways and Means, Senate Finance, and the National Economic Council taught me that information asymmetries undermine policymaking. PolicyEngine democratizes analysis by providing sophisticated capabilities to all, improving outcomes by enabling diverse voices.

The OSE aligns with Arnold Ventures' philosophy of building sustainable solutions through community contribution rather than grant dependence. I strongly urge NSF support for this essential democratic infrastructure.

Sincerely,

George Callas
