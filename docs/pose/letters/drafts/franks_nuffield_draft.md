Dear Review Committee:

As Director of Welfare Policy at the Nuffield Foundation, I am pleased to provide this letter of strong support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal to establish an Open-Source Ecosystem for transparent economic policy analysis. The Nuffield Foundation's substantial investment in PolicyEngine UK and our observation of its transformative impact on British policymaking provide compelling evidence for the value of supporting this critical infrastructure.

## Nuffield Foundation's Investment

The Nuffield Foundation has awarded PolicyEngine a Â£251,296 grant (September 2024-2025) to enhance, localise and democratise tax-benefit policy analysis through PolicyEngine UK. This investment enables PolicyEngine to model the complete UK tax and benefit system with unprecedented transparency, giving citizens, researchers, and civil society organisations free access to analytical capabilities previously restricted to government departments and well-resourced think tanks.

## UK Government Engagement

PolicyEngine's secondment to the Cabinet Office, documented in HM Treasury's Algorithmic Transparency Record, validates the platform's approach. Government economists are exploring how PolicyEngine can complement proprietary models while major UK policy institutions including IFS, Resolution Foundation, and Centre for Policy Studies have begun using PolicyEngine to validate their analyses.

## International Collaboration

The US-UK PolicyEngine collaboration demonstrates powerful network effects. UK innovations in benefit interactions immediately benefit US researchers, while US advances in state-level modelling inform our work on devolution. A formal Open-Source Ecosystem will institutionalise these exchanges, accelerating progress beyond what any single country could achieve independently.

## Support for the Open-Source Ecosystem

The Nuffield Foundation continues engagement through our existing grant and strategic partnerships. Our network of UK researchers, policymakers, and foundations positions us to help build community for a thriving ecosystem.

## Strategic Importance

PolicyEngine aligns with Nuffield's mission to improve social well-being and reduce inequality by democratising access to sophisticated policy analysis. Traditional closed models restrict analytical capabilities to elite institutions; PolicyEngine enables all stakeholders to engage as equals in policy debates. This transparency is essential for democratic legitimacy and the rapid, evidence-based responses needed to address challenges from inequality to climate transition.

## Recommendation

Based on the Nuffield Foundation's experience funding PolicyEngine UK and observing its transformative impact, I strongly urge NSF to support this Phase II proposal. The establishment of PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem represents critical infrastructure for evidence-based policymaking in democratic societies. The combination of technical excellence, commitment to transparency, proven government adoption, and international collaboration potential makes PolicyEngine uniquely positioned to create lasting positive impact.

NSF support will catalyse a global transformation in how societies analyse, debate, and implement public policy. The return on this investment, measured in improved policy outcomes and strengthened democratic governance, will far exceed its cost.

Sincerely,

Mark Franks
