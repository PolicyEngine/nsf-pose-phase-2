Dear Review Committee:

As Director of Welfare Policy at the Nuffield Foundation, I am pleased to provide this letter of strong support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal to establish an Open-Source Ecosystem for transparent economic policy analysis. The Nuffield Foundation's substantial investment in PolicyEngine UK and our observation of its transformative impact on British policymaking provide compelling evidence for the value of supporting this critical infrastructure.

## Nuffield Foundation's Investment in PolicyEngine

The Nuffield Foundation has awarded PolicyEngine a £250,000 grant to enhance PolicyEngine UK, recognizing its unique potential to democratize policy analysis and strengthen evidence-based decision-making. This investment, significant within our welfare portfolio, reflects our conviction that transparent, accessible analytical tools are fundamental to addressing inequality and promoting social justice.

Our support has enabled PolicyEngine to model the complete UK tax and benefit system with unprecedented transparency. For the first time, citizens, researchers, and civil society organizations have free access to the same analytical capabilities previously restricted to government departments and well-resourced think tanks. This democratization has already transformed policy discourse in the United Kingdom, elevating the quality of debate and enabling previously marginalized voices to contribute evidence-based insights.

## Impact on UK Government and Policy Discourse

The most striking validation of PolicyEngine's approach has been its adoption within the UK government itself. PolicyEngine's secondment to the Cabinet Office represents a watershed moment for government transparency in the United Kingdom. Government economists now use PolicyEngine alongside proprietary models, appreciating both its accuracy and the transparency that helps build public trust in official analyses. Citizens can access the same modeling capabilities, verified against official models but fully open for inspection and understanding.

This transparency has transformed how policy proposals are communicated and debated in Parliament. Members of Parliament increasingly reference PolicyEngine analyses during debates, knowing their constituents can verify calculations themselves. This has elevated the quality of policy discussion beyond partisan assertions to evidence-based deliberation. The recent Budget debates saw unprecedented public engagement with distributional analyses, enabled by PolicyEngine's accessible interface.

Major UK policy institutions including the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Resolution Foundation, and Centre for Policy Studies now use PolicyEngine to validate their analyses and ensure reproducibility. This convergence on a common, open platform strengthens the entire policy ecosystem by enabling researchers to build on each other's work rather than duplicating efforts with incompatible models.

## International Collaboration and Learning

The PolicyEngine collaboration between the United States and United Kingdom demonstrates the powerful network effects of open-source policy modeling. When UK researchers develop methods to handle complex benefit interactions, US researchers immediately benefit from these innovations. Conversely, advances in state-level modeling developed for the US federal system inform our work on devolution and regional policy variation in the UK.

This bidirectional learning extends beyond technical improvements. We regularly exchange insights about government adoption strategies, user engagement approaches, and sustainability models. The establishment of a formal Open-Source Ecosystem will institutionalize these exchanges, accelerating progress beyond what any single country could achieve independently.

## Commitment to the Open-Source Ecosystem

As PolicyEngine establishes its Open-Source Ecosystem, the Nuffield Foundation commits to continued engagement and support. We will evaluate additional grants to support UK-specific enhancements and features that enable international collaboration. Our extensive network of relationships with UK researchers, policymakers, and fellow foundations positions us to build the community necessary for a thriving ecosystem.

We will document and share evidence of PolicyEngine's impact on UK policymaking, providing valuable case studies for other countries considering adoption. Our convening power will facilitate knowledge exchange between US and UK users, ensuring both communities benefit from shared learning. I am personally committed to advocating for transparent policy analysis in our engagements with government and civil society, using PolicyEngine as an exemplar of what's possible.

## Alignment with Social Justice Mission

The Nuffield Foundation's mission centers on using evidence to improve social well-being and reduce inequality. PolicyEngine aligns perfectly with these goals by democratizing access to sophisticated policy analysis. Communities affected by policy changes can now analyze impacts themselves rather than relying on potentially biased intermediaries. Advocacy organizations can ground their arguments in rigorous evidence accessible to all. Researchers can rapidly test interventions to identify the most effective approaches to reducing poverty and inequality.

Traditional closed models perpetuate power imbalances by restricting analytical capabilities to elite institutions. PolicyEngine disrupts this dynamic, enabling grassroots organizations, local governments, and citizen groups to engage as equals in policy debates. This democratization is not merely procedural—it leads to better policies by incorporating diverse perspectives and lived experiences into policy design.

## Strategic Importance for Democratic Governance

My experience observing policy development across multiple countries confirms that transparency in analysis is essential for democratic legitimacy. When citizens cannot understand or verify how policy impacts are calculated, they lose trust in both the policies and the institutions that create them. PolicyEngine addresses this trust deficit by making all calculations visible and verifiable.

The challenges facing democratic societies—from inequality to climate transition to aging populations—require rapid, evidence-based policy responses. Closed, proprietary models cannot provide the agility and transparency these challenges demand. PolicyEngine's open-source approach enables rapid iteration, broad participation, and the trust necessary for implementing difficult but necessary reforms.

## Recommendation

Based on the Nuffield Foundation's experience funding PolicyEngine UK and observing its transformative impact, I strongly urge NSF to support this Phase II proposal. The establishment of PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem represents critical infrastructure for evidence-based policymaking in democratic societies. The combination of technical excellence, commitment to transparency, proven government adoption, and international collaboration potential makes PolicyEngine uniquely positioned to create lasting positive impact.

NSF support will catalyze a global transformation in how societies analyze, debate, and implement public policy. The return on this investment, measured in improved policy outcomes and strengthened democratic governance, will far exceed its cost.
