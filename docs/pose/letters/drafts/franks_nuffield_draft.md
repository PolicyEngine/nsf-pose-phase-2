Dear Review Committee:

I am writing in my capacity as Welfare Programme Head at the Nuffield Foundation to support PolicyEngine's application for NSF POSE Phase II funding.

The Nuffield Foundation invested £250,000 in PolicyEngine UK with a specific focus on documentation, user experience, and accessibility. This investment funded comprehensive documentation systems, API reference materials, and the tracing tools that help users understand how calculations flow through the system—precisely the type of infrastructure work that I understand the NSF POSE programme supports.

The impact has been substantial. Our documentation investment enabled the UK Cabinet Office to successfully adopt PolicyEngine, with civil servants now able to trace policy logic through the system without requiring developer support. HM Treasury published an Algorithmic Transparency Record (ATR-2024-007) documenting their use of the platform, demonstrating how proper documentation enables government adoption. The documentation we funded has also facilitated adoption by major UK policy institutions including the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Resolution Foundation, and Centre for Policy Studies.

What makes PolicyEngine particularly relevant to open-source ecosystem development is how documentation improvements create cascading benefits. When PolicyEngine presented their novel imputation methods at academic conferences, other organizations like the Yale Budget Lab could adopt these techniques because the documentation made them accessible. The investment in user guides and API documentation transformed a complex microsimulation engine into infrastructure that non-technical policy analysts can use effectively.

Based on our experience, PolicyEngine has demonstrated exceptional ability to leverage documentation and training investments into broader ecosystem adoption. The NSF POSE investment in ecosystem infrastructure—documentation, training, community building—would extend the work we've funded and generate substantial returns for the policy analysis community. I strongly encourage your support for this application.

Sincerely,
