NSF POSE Phase II Review Committee  
National Science Foundation  

Dear Review Committee:

I am writing to express my strong support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal to establish an Open-Source Ecosystem for economic policy modeling. As a Lawyer/Developer leading Rules as Code initiatives at the Canadian Digital Service, I have evaluated PolicyEngine extensively for potential adoption within the Canadian government and can attest to its transformative potential for modernizing how governments implement and communicate policy.

## Rules as Code and PolicyEngine Alignment

At the Canadian Digital Service and previously at the Canada School of Public Service's Rules as Code Lab, I have worked to bridge the gap between policy intent and computational implementation. This involves translating legislation and regulations into executable code that can power benefit calculators, eligibility systems, and policy simulation tools.

PolicyEngine represents the most mature and comprehensive implementation of Rules as Code principles I have encountered:

- **Legislative traceability**: Every calculation links to specific statutes and regulations
- **Version control**: Historical policy rules are preserved, enabling point-in-time calculations
- **Semantic clarity**: Policy concepts are encoded in human-readable form
- **Compositional design**: Complex policies build from simple, reusable components
- **Test-driven development**: Policy logic is validated against known scenarios

## Canadian Government Integration Efforts

I am actively working to integrate PolicyEngine into Canadian government systems:

1. **Pilot Projects**: Exploring PolicyEngine for modeling federal benefit interactions, particularly the Canada Child Benefit and its provincial variants
2. **Cross-jurisdictional analysis**: Using PolicyEngine's framework to understand federal-provincial policy interactions
3. **Service delivery improvement**: Demonstrating how PolicyEngine can power citizen-facing benefit calculators
4. **Policy development support**: Showing policy makers real-time impacts of proposed changes

The open-source nature is crucial for government adoption—it allows full auditing, ensures no vendor lock-in, and enables collaborative improvement across departments.

## Commitment to the OSE

As PolicyEngine establishes its Open-Source Ecosystem, I commit to:

- **International expansion**: Lead efforts to implement Canadian tax and benefit rules within PolicyEngine
- **Government advocacy**: Champion PolicyEngine adoption within Canadian federal and provincial governments
- **Rules as Code methodology**: Contribute best practices from our Rules as Code Lab experience
- **Bilingual support**: Help develop French-language capabilities essential for Canadian deployment
- **Cross-border learning**: Facilitate knowledge exchange between US, Canadian, and UK implementations

## Strategic Value for Government Modernization

Governments worldwide are recognizing that policy implementation through code requires new approaches. The traditional model—where policy is written in legal language, then interpreted by programmers—creates gaps between intent and implementation. PolicyEngine's OSE offers a better path:

- **Policy makers** can see exactly how rules are encoded
- **Service designers** can build accurate user interfaces
- **Auditors** can verify compliance with legislation
- **Citizens** can understand their entitlements
- **Researchers** can analyze policy impacts

## International Collaboration Potential

PolicyEngine's OSE can catalyze international collaboration on common challenges:

- **Harmonized modeling standards**: Common frameworks for encoding tax and benefit rules
- **Shared validation methods**: Cross-country learning on accuracy and testing
- **Comparative analysis tools**: Understanding how different countries approach similar problems
- **Open government advancement**: Demonstrating transparency in policy implementation

Canada's experience with Rules as Code, combined with PolicyEngine's technical foundation, can accelerate adoption across governments seeking to modernize policy delivery.

## The Open Source Imperative for Government

Government policy tools must be transparent and trustworthy. Citizens have a right to understand how policies affecting them are calculated. Closed-source models, whether commercial or government-built, cannot provide this transparency. PolicyEngine's open approach aligns with principles of open government and democratic accountability.

Moreover, the OSE model enables something impossible with proprietary systems: continuous improvement through community contribution. When a provincial government improves modeling of childcare subsidies, that enhancement benefits everyone. This collaborative approach is essential for keeping pace with policy evolution.

## Recommendation

I strongly recommend NSF support for PolicyEngine's Phase II proposal. As someone who has spent years working to modernize government policy implementation, I can confirm that PolicyEngine provides critical infrastructure for 21st-century governance. The OSE will ensure this infrastructure remains open, improves continuously, and serves governments worldwide in their mission to deliver policy effectively and transparently.

The combination of technical sophistication, commitment to openness, and practical government application makes PolicyEngine uniquely positioned to transform how democratic societies implement and understand public policy.
