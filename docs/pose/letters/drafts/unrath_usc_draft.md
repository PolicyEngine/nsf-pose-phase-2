Dear Review Committee:

I strongly support PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. As a former Census Bureau economist working on the National Experimental Wellbeing Statistics project and now at USC, I understand both government needs and research applications for transparent policy modeling.

At Census, working with closed-source tax models exposed critical limitations: inability to examine logic when results were unexpected, delays waiting for updates to implement new provisions, and challenges validating against administrative records. These constraints fundamentally limited our statistical production.

PolicyEngine's availability unlocked my IRP/HHS-funded project analyzing marginal tax rates and benefit cliffsâ€”only a fully open tax-benefit rules engine that could be applied to administrative data could answer these research questions. PolicyEngine's integration of federal/state taxes with SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, and other programs reveals cliffs invisible when programs are analyzed separately, with state-specific modeling capturing crucial geographic variations. Through relationships with Census colleagues including Jon Rothbaum, I'm exploring PolicyEngine adoption for the Supplemental Poverty Measure and distributional national accounts.

My position at USC's Sol Price School provides opportunities to introduce students and colleagues to transparent policy modeling tools, potentially creating a pipeline of analysts familiar with open-source approaches. My research on marginal tax rates and benefit cliffs exemplifies why PolicyEngine's OSE is essential for evidence-based policy. Current policy debates suffer from fragmented analysis where different agencies model their programs in isolation, missing critical interaction effects.

PolicyEngine's integrated, open approach transforms this landscape. Researchers can analyze the full complexity of the safety net, understanding how programs interact. Real-time updates ensure analysis reflects current law. Transparency allows stakeholders to understand and verify findings, building consensus around evidence rather than arguing about black-box results.

Based on my experience in both government and academia, I strongly recommend NSF support for PolicyEngine's Phase II proposal. The platform addresses critical infrastructure gaps limiting our ability to design effective social policy. PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem meets varied stakeholder needs through a community-driven model ensuring continuous improvement and broad accessibility. NSF support will catalyze adoption across institutions, creating network effects that benefit the entire policy analysis ecosystem.

Sincerely,
