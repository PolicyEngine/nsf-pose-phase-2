Dear Review Committee:

I strongly support PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. As a former Census Bureau economist working on the National Experimental Wellbeing Statistics project and now at USC, I understand both government needs and research applications for transparent policy modeling.

## Background

At Census, the NEWS project's reliance on TAXSIM exposed critical limitations: inability to examine logic when results were unexpected, delays waiting for updates to implement new provisions, and inability to validate against administrative records. These constraints fundamentally limited our statistical production.

## Current Work

For my IRP/HHS-funded project analyzing marginal tax rates and benefit cliffs, I'm exploring PolicyEngine's integration of federal/state taxes with SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, and other programs. This comprehensive approach reveals cliffs invisible when programs are analyzed separately, with state-specific modeling capturing crucial geographic variations.

## Government Bridge

Through relationships with Census colleagues including Jon Rothbaum, I'm exploring PolicyEngine adoption for the Supplemental Poverty Measure and distributional national accounts.

## Academic Perspective

My position at USC's Sol Price School provides opportunities to introduce students and colleagues to transparent policy modeling tools, potentially creating a pipeline of analysts familiar with open-source approaches.

## Strategic Importance for Policy Research

My research on marginal tax rates and benefit cliffs exemplifies why PolicyEngine's OSE is essential for evidence-based policy. Current policy debates suffer from fragmented analysis where different agencies model their programs in isolation, missing critical interaction effects. State variations in program rules are often ignored due to modeling constraints, leading to federal policies that work poorly in specific states. Updates to models lag policy changes by months or years, preventing timely analysis when decisions are being made.

PolicyEngine's integrated, open approach transforms this landscape. Researchers can analyze the full complexity of the safety net, understanding how programs interact to create poverty traps or work incentives. Real-time updates ensure analysis reflects current law, not outdated rules. Transparency allows stakeholders to understand and verify findings, building consensus around evidence rather than arguing about black-box results.

## Recommendation

Based on my experience in both government and academia, I strongly recommend NSF support for PolicyEngine's Phase II proposal. The platform addresses critical infrastructure gaps that limit our ability to design effective social policy. Government agencies need transparent tools that satisfy public accountability requirements while maintaining analytical rigor. Academic researchers need comprehensive models that capture real-world complexity while remaining scientifically reproducible. State and local governments need accessible tools that reflect their specific policies without requiring expensive customization.

PolicyEngine's Open-Source Ecosystem meets all these needs through a community-driven model that ensures continuous improvement and broad accessibility. NSF support will catalyze adoption across institutions, creating network effects that benefit the entire policy analysis ecosystem. The result will be better informed policy decisions based on transparent, comprehensive, and timely analysis.
