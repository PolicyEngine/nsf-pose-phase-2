NSF POSE Phase II Review Committee  
National Science Foundation  

Dear Review Committee:

I am writing to express my enthusiastic support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal to establish an Open-Source Ecosystem for transparent economic policy analysis. As an Assistant Professor at USC's Sol Price School of Public Policy and former U.S. Census Bureau economist, I have both used PolicyEngine extensively in my research and observed its potential to transform how government agencies conduct policy analysis.

## Research Applications and Current Use

I am currently using PolicyEngine for a major research project funded by the Institute for Research on Poverty (IRP) through the Department of Health and Human Services. This project analyzes the distribution of marginal tax rates and benefit cliffs using administrative data, addressing critical questions about work incentives in the American safety net.

PolicyEngine has proven invaluable for this research because it:

- **Integrates tax and transfer programs**: Unlike single-program models, PolicyEngine captures the full effective marginal tax rate including federal taxes, state taxes, SNAP, TANF, childcare subsidies, and housing assistance
- **Handles administrative data**: Can process custom microdata files while maintaining privacy protections
- **Enables cliff identification**: Precisely identifies benefit cliffs that create work disincentives
- **Provides geographic variation**: Models state-specific policies crucial for understanding regional differences

The open-source nature allows me to verify calculations against administrative records and modify assumptions based on empirical findingsâ€”impossible with closed models.

## Census Bureau Experience and Government Potential

During my time at the Census Bureau, I worked on the NEWS (New Economic Well-being Statistics) project, which relied on TAXSIM for tax calculations. This experience highlighted both the importance and limitations of closed-source models in government statistics:

- **Reproducibility challenges**: When TAXSIM produced unexpected results, we couldn't examine the logic
- **Update delays**: Implementing new tax provisions required waiting for external updates
- **Limited integration**: Difficulty combining TAXSIM with other benefit programs
- **Validation obstacles**: Couldn't fully verify calculations against administrative tax data

PolicyEngine addresses each of these limitations. I maintain close connections with Census colleagues, including recent meetings with Jon Rothbaum and others exploring PolicyEngine for official statistics.

## Commitment to Government Adoption

As PolicyEngine develops its OSE, I commit to:

1. **Census Bureau advocacy**: Leverage my relationships to promote PolicyEngine adoption for projects like the Supplemental Poverty Measure and distributional national accounts
2. **Administrative data integration**: Share methods for using PolicyEngine with restricted-access government microdata
3. **Validation frameworks**: Contribute code comparing PolicyEngine outputs to administrative records
4. **Training materials**: Develop resources helping government economists transition from TAXSIM to PolicyEngine
5. **Research collaboration**: Connect academic researchers with government analysts using common tools

## Strategic Importance for Evidence-Based Policy

My research on marginal tax rates and benefit cliffs illustrates why PolicyEngine's OSE is essential. Current debates about work requirements, benefit phase-outs, and tax credits lack comprehensive analysis because:

- Different agencies model different programs in isolation
- State variations are often ignored
- Interaction effects are poorly understood
- Updates lag policy changes

PolicyEngine's integrated, open approach can transform this landscape, enabling:

- Comprehensive effective tax rate analysis
- Real-time policy impact assessment
- State-federal coordination
- Academic-government collaboration

## The Open Source Advantage for Government

Government agencies face unique challenges that PolicyEngine's OSE addresses:

**Transparency requirements**: FOIA and public accountability demand openness
**Budget constraints**: Open source eliminates licensing costs
**Interagency coordination**: Common tools facilitate collaboration
**Continuity**: Open code survives staff transitions
**Public trust**: Citizens can verify government calculations

My Census experience confirmed that proprietary models create unnecessary barriers to good government. PolicyEngine's open approach aligns with government transparency mandates while improving analytical quality.

## Research and Teaching Integration

At USC, I'm integrating PolicyEngine into both research and teaching:

- **Graduate courses**: Training next-generation policy analysts on open tools
- **Student research**: Enabling dissertations using cutting-edge methods
- **Policy labs**: Connecting students with real-world policy problems
- **Practitioner workshops**: Teaching state and local officials to use PolicyEngine

The OSE will ensure these educational investments create lasting value for the policy community.

## Recommendation

Based on my experience as both a government economist and academic researcher, I strongly recommend NSF support for PolicyEngine's Phase II proposal. The platform addresses critical gaps in our policy analysis infrastructure:

- Bridges the academic-government divide
- Enables comprehensive multi-program analysis
- Provides transparency essential for public trust
- Reduces duplication of effort across institutions

PolicyEngine's OSE represents essential infrastructure for evidence-based policymaking. NSF support will catalyze adoption across government agencies, research institutions, and policy organizations, multiplying its impact on American social policy.
