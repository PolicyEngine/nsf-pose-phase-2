Dear Review Committee:

I am writing to express my strongest support for PolicyEngine's Phase II POSE proposal. As former Assistant Director at the Federal Reserve Board overseeing the Survey of Consumer Finances and former Chief of Long-Term Modeling at CBO, I have unique insight into PolicyEngine's transformative potential.

Having overseen the SCF at the Federal Reserve and directed CBOLT development at CBO, I understand the constraints of closed-source models. With TAXSIM, researchers cannot examine edge cases, verify assumptions, or contribute improvements—fundamentally limiting research progress. The contrast with PolicyEngine's open approach could not be starker.

PolicyEngine provides not just a comprehensive rules engine delivering more value to TAXSIM users through open source and integrated benefits, but also innovates on the data side through advanced microdata calibration tools. As a member of the NASEM panel on an integrated income/consumption/wealth dataset, I recognize that PolicyEngine has already built such a system in the UK by applying these tools and is capable of delivering the same in the US. The NASEM report was aspirational, but PolicyEngine's open-source technologies enable its realization—even potentially for constructing longitudinal datasets that form the backbone of Social Security policy simulations likely to take center stage in public finance conversations in coming years, given the projected depletion of the OASI trust fund in 2033.

I am exploring PolicyEngine's microdata calibration to enhance the SCF by imputing state identifiers (excluded for confidentiality), enabling state tax calculations while maintaining privacy. I'm also exploring PolicyEngine for Social Security reform analysis and coordinating with economists at Brookings and government agencies to document advantages over TAXSIM. My CBOLT experience provides insights for dynamic scoring development, and my connections at CBO, Treasury, Census, and the Federal Reserve position me to discuss transparent modeling benefits.

Having built models within government, I understand that transparency is essential for democratic legitimacy. PolicyEngine addresses the reproducibility crisis stemming from proprietary models and enables rapid policy response without depending on single maintainers. For Social Security reform affecting every American, PolicyEngine's transparency allows stakeholders to verify impacts—essential for democratic governance.

I strongly urge NSF support. PolicyEngine represents the future of economic policy analysis and is uniquely positioned to lead this transformation.

Please feel free to contact me if you require any additional information about PolicyEngine's capabilities or my collaboration with their team.

Sincerely,
