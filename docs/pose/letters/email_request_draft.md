Subject: Quick letter of collaboration for NSF POSE Phase II (due Tue)

Hi <Name>,

We’re submitting an NSF POSE Phase II proposal for PolicyEngine, due Tue at 5pm local. Could you provide a ≤2‑page Letter of Collaboration confirming:

1) Your current use and/or contributions (specific features, analyses, PRs/issues, docs, datasets)
2) Planned engagement during the project (pilots, validation, contributions) and expected impact
3) Your affiliation and relationship to our team (you are not on the proposing team)

Format: PDF preferred; letterhead if possible (not required); ≤2 pages; signature/date helpful.

We’ve attached a short template to make this easy. Aiming for 3–5 letters total; if you can send by <DATE, TIMEZONE>, that would be perfect.

Thank you!
— <Your Name>
