# Thank You Email to Matt Unrath

Subject: Thank you! NSF POSE letter received

Thank you, Matt, this is perfect! Your emphasis on the methodology and restricted-use data really strengthens our application. Sorry about the PhD mix-up.

I should have also mentioned what we propose with the grant as it pertains to your work. While we can't use it for developing the software per se, it would let us have full-time people dedicated to helping researchers integrate PolicyEngine into their pipelines - providing documentation, training, and support for administrative data workflows. Excited for what this could mean for more projects like your IRP one and government use cases.

Grateful for our collaboration!
