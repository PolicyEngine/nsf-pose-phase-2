# Response to Mark Franks (Final)

Subject: Re: NSF POSE Letter - Brief Summary & Alternatives

Dear Mark,

Thank you for the quick response, and I completely understand your position.

I should have explained the grant better. The $1.5M over 2 years would support ecosystem infrastructure (not core software development):
- **Documentation & training** - Building on what Nuffield funded, creating comprehensive tutorials, API docs, and tracing tools that help both new users and experts (like Cabinet Office and HM Treasury with our Python package) understand the logic flow through parameters and variables
- **Community programs** - Contributor onboarding, mentorship, office hours, hackathons
- **International coordination** - Supporting community building as we expand to Canada (where we have a working system) and eventually other countries as programmatic funding enables the core development
- **Infrastructure** - Continuous testing pipelines, security practices, release engineering

Essentially, it's about making the existing system more accessible and sustainable through better documentation, training, and community support - areas where your Nuffield investment has already shown impact.

I've adjusted the draft to connect the proposal more to Nuffield's investment in similar initiatives like documentation, and how that has enabled high-impact use cases like Cabinet Office. No worries at all if you don't feel comfortable endorsing - we have a couple backups.

Thanks again for considering this on short notice!

Best,
Max
