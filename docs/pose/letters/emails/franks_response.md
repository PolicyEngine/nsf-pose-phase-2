# Response to Mark Franks

Subject: Re: NSF POSE Letter - Brief Summary & Alternatives

Dear Mark,

Thank you for the quick response, and I completely understand your position.

I should have explained the grant better. The $1.5M over 2 years would support ecosystem infrastructure (not core software development):
- **Documentation & training** - Building on what Nuffield funded, creating comprehensive tutorials, API docs, and tracing tools that help both new users and experts (like Cabinet Office and HM Treasury with our Python package) understand the logic flow through parameters and variables
- **Community programs** - Contributor onboarding, mentorship, office hours, hackathons
- **International coordination** - Supporting community building as we expand to Canada (where we have a working system) and eventually other countries as programmatic funding enables the core development
- **Infrastructure** - CI/CD pipelines, security practices, release engineering

Essentially, it's about making the existing system more accessible and sustainable through better documentation, training, and community support - areas where your Nuffield investment has already shown impact.

If you're comfortable, I've drafted a letter focusing specifically on how Nuffield's documentation investment enabled Cabinet Office adoption and created the cascading benefits you've seen. The draft includes two options for both the opening and closing paragraphs:
- Option A includes direct endorsement ("to support PolicyEngine's application")
- Option B stays neutral ("merits careful consideration")

Please choose whichever version you're comfortable with, or feel free to edit as you see fit.

Thanks again for considering this on short notice!

Best,
Max
