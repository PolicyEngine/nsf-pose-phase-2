# Thank You Email to Mark Franks

Subject: Thank you! Letter received - perfect timing

Dear Mark,

Thank you so much for the quick turnaround and strong letter! Your emphasis on the Cabinet Office secondment and the spillover effects between US-UK collaboration really strengthens our application. The specific mention of NIESR, NEF, and Centre for Policy Studies is particularly valuable.

Since I already started writing, I thought I'd share more detail about what the NSF POSE grant would support:

The $1.5M over 2 years focuses entirely on ecosystem infrastructure (not core software):
- **Documentation & training** ($400k) - Comprehensive API docs, tutorials, and the tracing tools you mentioned, helping users understand calculation flows
- **Community programs** ($300k) - Contributor onboarding, mentorship programs, quarterly hackathons, office hours
- **International coordination** ($200k) - Supporting community building as we expand (we have a partly-built Canada model and early prototypes in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Israel, and Nigeria)
- **Infrastructure** ($300k) - Security audits, continuous testing pipelines, release engineering
- **Evaluation** ($100k) - Independent assessment of ecosystem health metrics

The goal is to transition from a successful product (which Nuffield helped build) to a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem with distributed governance, much like other successful projects (NumPy, Jupyter, etc.).

Your point about US-UK spillovers is exactly right - the POSE grant would formalize these knowledge exchanges through structured collaboration programs. The small area estimates work you're funding in the UK could directly benefit US congressional district analysis, while our US state tax modeling helps inform devolution analysis.

Thanks again for your support. The combination of Nuffield's investment demonstrating impact and NSF's ecosystem infrastructure support could truly transform policy analysis accessibility globally.

Best regards,
Max
