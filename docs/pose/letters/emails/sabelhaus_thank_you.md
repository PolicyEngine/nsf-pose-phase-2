# Thank You Email to John Sabelhaus

Subject: Thank you! Incredibly strong letter

John,

This is perfect - thank you! Your "strongly urge NSF support" endorsement and the specific mention of developing the public use longitudinal file for an OS integrated micro, macro, and budget model is exactly the kind of concrete commitment that strengthens our application.

The addition about coordinating with Brookings and government agencies to document advantages over TAXSIM is particularly valuable - it shows ecosystem building already happening.

Grateful for your support and looking forward to building this open infrastructure together!

Best,
Max
