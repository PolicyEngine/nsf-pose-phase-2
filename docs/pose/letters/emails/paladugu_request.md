Subject: NSF POSE Phase II - Letter highlighting benefit screening use case?

Hi Sekhar,

As we're finalizing our NSF POSE Phase II application (due today at 5pm), I realized we're missing a critical perspective on benefit screening and navigation - exactly your area of expertise.

While our other letters focus on policy analysis and research, none capture how PolicyEngine's open infrastructure enables organizations like MyFriendBen to screen clients across multiple programs simultaneously. Your perspective on how transparent eligibility engines reduce administrative burden and increase benefit uptake would add unique value - especially given MyFriendBen's success identifying $800M in available benefits in Colorado.

I've drafted a brief letter focusing on:
- How MyFriendBen could leverage PolicyEngine for multi-program screening
- The value of transparent rules for benefit navigators
- Potential integration with your existing systems
- Impact on reducing the benefits access gap

I know this is incredibly last minute - if you can't provide a letter by 3pm ET, no worries at all. But if you have a few minutes to review and adapt the draft, it would strengthen our application's broader impacts beyond traditional policy analysis.

Thanks for considering!
Max
