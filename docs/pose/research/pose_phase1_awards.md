POSE Phase I Awardees — Research Notes

This file tracks sources and a repeatable path to list POSE Phase I awardees (organization, PI, title, amount, year, abstract). Once exported, we will summarize themes and potential letter targets.

Where to Pull Awards
- NSF Program page → Awards section
  - Program page saved: `materials/phase2/pose-program.html`
  - “Awards made through this program” — Advanced Award Search (filtered by program element code 211Y00):
    - https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearchResult?ProgEleCode=211Y00&BooleanElement=Any&BooleanRef=Any#results
    - Tip: Uncheck “Active Awards” in the UI to include past awards, then export.
  - Map of recent awards (Tableau):
    - https://tableau.external.nsf.gov/views/ProgramAwards/Summary?pims_id=505982
    - CSV summary by state saved to `materials/phase2/program_awards_summary.csv` (award counts/amounts by state — not the detailed list).

Target Output
- awards.csv — columns: Award Number, Organization, PI, Title, Amount, Start Date, End Date, City/State, Abstract.
- awards.md — readable list with 1–2 line summaries per award.

Next Steps
- Export detailed award list (CSV) from Advanced Award Search using the link above (include historical, not just active awards).
- Save as `materials/phase2/pose_phase_awards.csv`.
- I will convert to `docs/pose/research/pose_phase1_awards_list.md` and a condensed 1‑page summary of themes (governance models, domains, OSE patterns) to inform our Phase II positioning.
