# NSF POSE Phase 2 Restructuring Plan

## Core Pitch (Single Clear Message)
PolicyEngine is building an open-source ecosystem for **tax-benefit microsimulation** that democratizes policy analysis - making tools previously available only to well-resourced institutions accessible to state/local governments, universities, and community organizations.

## Evidence of Demand (from letters and engagement)
- **Research**: USC using for marginal tax rates/benefit cliffs, Brookings for Social Security reform
- **Government**: UK Cabinet Office, US Joint Economic Committee, state legislators (Gounardes, Parker)
- **Education**: USC, Georgetown planned integration
- **Benefits Access**: MyFriendBen ($2.4M Gates grant) using API for multi-state screening
- **State/Local**: NCSL engagement shows massive unmet demand

## Target Structure (4,000 words total)

### 1. Project Summary (400 words)
- Clear single pitch: Open-source tax-benefit microsimulation infrastructure
- Not three different ideas - ONE unified ecosystem
- Concrete impact metrics from current usage

### 2. Context of OSE (600 words)
- Vision: Democratize tax-benefit microsimulation 
- Current barrier: Only 12 institutions have models (TPC $3.2M/year, PWBM $1.8M/year)
- Our solution: Zero-cost, transparent alternative already validated against TAXSIM
- Phase I/I-Corps: Focus on state/local needs discovery

### 3. Ecosystem Establishment (800 words)
Focus on THREE concrete ecosystems:
1. **US+UK Policy Analysis Ecosystem**
   - Current users: NBER, USC, Niskanen, UK Cabinet Office
   - Growth: State legislatures, universities, think tanks
   
2. **Benefits Access Ecosystem** 
   - MyFriendBen partnership ($800M benefits identified)
   - Multi-state expansion with Gates funding
   - Rules engine for eligibility determination
   
3. **Education/Training Ecosystem**
   - Curriculum development for econ/policy schools
   - Guest lectures and workshop program
   - Internship pipeline for platform users (not just developers)

### 4. Organization/Governance (400 words)
- Steering committee with user representation
- Technical working groups by domain
- Clear contribution pathways
- Release management process

### 5. Continuous Development (600 words) 
CENTER ON TRAINING/CURRICULUM:
- Educational modules for policy schools
- "Baby steps" onboarding for non-technical users
- Conversion guide for Tax-Calculator users
- State/local government training program
- Regular workshops at NCSL, NTA, ASSA

### 6. Community Building (400 words)
- Focus on USER community not just developers
- Office hours for policy analysts
- Documentation for different user types
- Peer support networks by use case

### 7. Sustainability (300 words)
- Diversified funding (government, philanthropy, commercial)
- Fee-for-service training and support
- API licensing for commercial users
- Consortium model for state governments

### 8. Evaluation (300 words)
- User growth metrics
- Policy analyses conducted
- Educational institutions using platform
- State/local governments served

### 9. Risk Mitigation (200 words)
- Technical: Security, validation, testing
- Organizational: Succession planning
- Keep brief - not the focus

## Key Changes from Current Draft

### REMOVE:
- Excessive technical detail about QRF, L0 optimization
- Repeated mentions of same partnerships
- Long lists of potential applications
- International expansion beyond UK (keep Canada brief)
- Detailed I-Corps process description

### EMPHASIZE:
- Tax-benefit microsimulation as core mission
- Concrete current usage and impact
- State/local government demand
- Educational integration and curriculum
- Training and onboarding programs
- Benefits access use cases

### SPECIFIC EXAMPLES TO HIGHLIGHT:
- MyFriendBen: $800M benefits identified in Colorado
- USC: Marginal tax rate research unlocked by PolicyEngine
- NCSL: Direct engagement with state legislators
- UK Cabinet Office: Government validation of approach

## Next Steps
1. Rewrite project summary with single clear pitch
2. Condense technical sections to essentials
3. Expand education/training content
4. Add specific state/local examples
5. Create clear ecosystem diagrams
6. Ensure 15-page limit (~250 words/page)
