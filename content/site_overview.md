## Project Overview

PolicyEngine is establishing a sustainable, robust open‑source ecosystem (OSE) for transparent tax‑and‑benefit microsimulation. We transition an already deployed product into a community‑driven platform with formal governance, secure supply‑chain practices, and clear contributor pathways.

## What We’re Building
- Secure, reproducible policy microsimulation platform with validated US rules (federal and state) and growing program coverage.
- Enhanced microdata pipeline:
  - MicroImpute: quantile regression forest imputation and benchmarking.
  - MicroCalibrate: gradient‑descent reweighting with optional L0 sparsity to match administrative targets; metrics and dashboards.
- Governance and community: steering group, working groups, RFC process, contributor onboarding and mentorship.

## Early Partners and Adoption
PolicyEngine is already in use by legislative and research teams. The U.S. Joint Economic Committee has examined distributional and budget questions with the platform. New York State Senator Andrew Gounardes’s office and D.C. Councilmember Zachary Parker’s office used the rules engine to simulate tax‑credit reform proposals. The Niskanen Center employs the model for public‑interest policy analysis, and the New York Times used PolicyEngine during its coverage of the 2025 reconciliation bill (the work was not published when the bill moved faster than expected but improved our release and validation processes). In the UK, the Cabinet Office engagement is aligning workflows for government use. Academic and nonprofit pilots (e.g., NBER‑affiliated teams, Georgetown, USC, MyFriendBen) continue to support validation, teaching, and benefit navigation. With Nuffield support, Citizen Codex ran a UX research study that informs contributor onboarding and documentation. An MOU with NBER anchors large‑scale cross‑model validation (with TAXSIM archives), and Arnold‑supported SALT‑AMT analysis has been used to brief congressional staff; UK policy institutes including IFS, Resolution Foundation, and the Centre for Policy Studies have begun using PolicyEngine for validation.

## Near‑Term Deliverables
- State and congressional district weights (Arnold Ventures support; building on Nuffield‑funded UK work).
- Signed releases and SBOM, CODEOWNERS and security policy, reproducible pipelines.
- Contributor workshops, maintainer onboarding, and case studies.

## Why This Matters
Democratizes access to high‑quality policy analysis; improves transparency and reproducibility in applied economics; accelerates evidence‑based policymaking; and trains contributors in secure open‑source practices.
