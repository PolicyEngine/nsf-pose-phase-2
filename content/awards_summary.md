POSE Phase I Winners — Patterns And What We’re Emphasizing

What Phase I Awardees Look Like
- Domains span health (mindLAMP; neuromodulation), HPC (ColdFront), data viz/VR (OpenCIVAN), scientific tooling (OpenViSUS), robotics (marine robotics), AI (trustworthy LLMs; ACT‑R), geospatial data sharing, quantum (qBraid), and policy (PolicyEngine via PSL Foundation).
- Common thread: established open‑source products with real external users/contributors and a credible plan to formalize an OSE: governance, contribution pathways, CI/release hygiene, documentation/training, and partner pilots.
- Typical commitments: signed releases + SBOM; codeowners and RFCs; onboarding docs and workshops; metrics dashboards; letters from independent users/contributors; training (I‑Corps for POSE); evaluation plans.

Implications For Our Phase II
- Governance & Security: We’re foregrounding CODEOWNERS, RFCs, incident response, signed releases, SBOM, and supply‑chain scanning (OSE enablement over feature dev).
- Community & Training: Contributor pathways, mentorship, office hours, workshops; January I‑Corps for POSE cohort plan; partner pilots (benefit platforms; government workflows).
- External Validation: State TAXSIM validations; Enhanced CPS calibration metrics; reproducible pipelines; versioned releases; letters planned from independent users/contributors (3–5 required).
- Distributed Development: Modular packages (L0, MicroImpute, MicroCalibrate) with typed APIs and tests; CI for builds, coverage, security; backport policy for LTS.

Where We Map To Phase I Patterns
- Established OSS with users: PolicyEngine is already in production for analysis and benefit navigation; active research/publication cadence.
- Formal OSE plan: Clear governance structure, security plan, onboarding materials, and release operations; public roadmap and metrics.
- Partner pilots: UK Cabinet Office engagement (template for U.S. onboarding), benefit navigation partners, and academic labs for validation and teaching.
- Evaluation & Status: Word‑counted application assembly; calibration and adoption dashboards; checklist of RWR items; per‑section status.

Adjustments We’re Making (Based On Winners)
- Letters: Optimize for specificity—current use/contribution plus planned role and expected impact (≤2 pages). Government letter in individual capacity if needed.
- Evidence density: Insert concrete counts (external PRs/issues, releases/tags, state validations, calibration targets within tolerance, pilot deployments).
- OSE enablement budget: Keep POSE funds focused on governance, security, onboarding, release/process work; avoid net‑new feature development in budget narrative.

Suggested Letter Targets (Illustrative)
- Benefit Navigator / ImagineLA (API use), MyFriendBen (integration), academic labs (e.g., NBER‑affiliated researchers), government partner (UK engagement in individual capacity), an additional research user.
